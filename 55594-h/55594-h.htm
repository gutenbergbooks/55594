<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Which is to be read, if it haint askin’ too much of
the kind hearted reader.</p>

<p>In the first days of our married life, I strained
nearly every nerve to help my companion Josiah along
and take care of his children by his former consort,
the subject of black African slavery also wearin’ on
me, and a mortgage of 200 and 50 dollars on the farm.
But as we prospered and the mortgage was cleared,
and the children were off to school, the black African
also bein’ liberated about the same time of the mortgage,
then my mind bein’ free from these cares&mdash;the
great subject of Wimmen’s Rites kept a goarin’ me,
and a voice kept a sayin’ inside of me,</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen’s wife, write a book givin’ your
views on the great subject of Wimmen’s Rites.” But
I hung back in spirit from the idea and says I, to myself,
“I never went to school much and don’t know
nothin’ about grammer, and I never could spell worth
a cent.”</p>

<p>But still that deep voice kept a ’swaiden me&mdash;“Josiah
Allen’s wife, write a book.”</p>

<p>Says I, “I can’t write a book, I don’t know no underground
dungeons, I haint acquainted with no haunted
houses, I never see a hero suspended over a abyss by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
his gallusses, I never beheld a heroine swoon away, I
never see a Injun tommy hawked, nor a ghost; I
never had any of these advantages; I can’t write a
book.”</p>

<p>But still it kept a sayin’ inside of my mind, “Josiah
Allen’s wife write a book about your life, as it passes
in front of you and Josiah, daily, and your views on
Wimmen’s Rites. The great publick wheel is a rollin’
on slowly, drawin’ the Femail Race into liberty;
Josiah Allen’s wife, put your shoulder blades to the
wheel.”</p>

<p>And so that almost hauntin’ voice inside of me
kept a ’swaidin me, and finally I spoke out in a loud
clear voice and answered it&mdash;</p>

<p>“I <em>will</em> put my shoulder blades to the wheel.”</p>

<p>I well remember the time I said it, for it skairt
Josiah almost to death. It was night and we was both
settin’ by the fire relapsted into silence and he&mdash;not
knowin’ the conversation goin’ on inside of my mind,
thought I was crazy, and jumped up as if he was shot,
and says he, in tremblin’ tones,</p>

<p>“What is the matter Samantha?”</p>

<p>Says I, “Josiah I am goin’ to write a book.”</p>

<p>This skairt him worse than ever&mdash;I could see, by
his ghastly countenance&mdash;and he started off on the
run for the camfire bottle.</p>

<p>Says I, in firm but gentle axcents, “camfire can’t
stop me Josiah, the book will be wrote.”</p>

<p>He see by my pale but calm countenance, that I
was not delirious any, and (by experience) he knows
that when my mind is made up, I have got a firm and
almost cast iron resolution. He said no more, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
sot down and sithed hevily; finally he spoke out in a
despairin’ tone, he is pretty close (but honest),</p>

<p>“Who will read the book Samantha? Remember
if you write it you have got to stand the brunt of it
yourself&mdash;I haint no money to hire folks with to read
it.” And again he sithed two or three times. And
he hadn’t much more than got through sithein’ when
he asked me again in a tone of almost agony&mdash;</p>

<p>“Who will read the book Samantha after you write
it?”</p>

<p>The same question was fillin’ me with agonizin’
apprehension, but I concealed it and answered with
almost marble calm,</p>

<p>“I don’t know Josiah, but I am determined to put
my shoulder blades to the wheel and write it.”</p>

<p>Josiah didn’t say no more then, but it wore on him&mdash;for
that night in the ded of night he spoke out in
his sleep in a kind of a wild way,</p>

<p>“Who will read the book?”</p>

<p>I hunched him with my elbo’ to wake him up, and
he muttered&mdash;“I won’t pay out one cent of my money
to hire any body to read it.”</p>

<p>I pitied him, for I was afraid it would end in the
Night Mair, and I waked him up, and promised him
then and there, that I never would ask him to pay
out one cent to hire any body to read it. He has perfect
confidence in me and he brightened up and haint
never said a word sense against the idea, and that is
the way this book come to be wrote.</p>

<h2 id="MARRIED_TO_JOSIAH_ALLEN">MARRIED TO JOSIAH ALLEN.</h2>

<p>If anybody had told me when I was first born that
I would marry to a widower, I should have been
mad at ’em. I lived up to this idee quite a number
of years, how many, is nobody’s business, that I will
contend for. I laughed at the idee of love in my blindness
of eye. But the first minute I sot my grey eye
onto Josiah Allen I knew my fate. My heart was a
pray to feelin’s it had heretofore been a stranger to.</p>

<p>Sez I to myself “Is this love?” I couldn’t answer,
I was too agitated.</p>

<p>Josiah told me afterwards that he felt jest exactly
the same, only, when his heart wildly put the question
to him, “Is it love you feel for Samantha Smith?” he
havin’ experience in the same, answered, “Yes, it is
love.”</p>

<p>I married Josiah Allen (in mother’s parlor, on the
fourteenth day of June, in a bran new silk dress with
a long boddis waist) from pure love. Though why I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
loved him, I know not. I looked at his mild face
beamin’ on me from above his black silk stock, which
kep’ his head kinder stiff, and asked myself this question,
“Why do you love him?” I reckolected then,
and I have recalled it to his mind several times sense
in our little differences of opinion, which occur in the
happiest families&mdash;that I had had offers from men,
handsomer than him, with more intelect than him, with
more riches than him, with less children than him.
Why didn’t I love these various men? I knew not.
I can only repeat in the immortal and almost deathless
lines of the poet, “Love will go where it is sent.”</p>

<p>Yes, Josiah Allen was my fate, and when I laid my
light silk glove in his’en (they was almost of a color,
a kind of cinnemen broun) before the alter, or that is
before Elder Wesley Minkley, I did it with the purest
and tenderest emotions of love.</p>

<p>And that love has been like a Becon in our pathway
ever sense. Its pure light, though it has sputtered
some, and in tryin’ times such as washin’ days and
cleanin’ house times has burnt down pretty low,&mdash;has
never gone out.</p>

<p>When I married him the bald spot on his head wuzn’t
much bigger than a new silver dollar. Now the
top of his head is as smooth and clean as one of my
stun china dinner plates, and if any horse jocky was to
try to judge of his age by lookin’ at his teeth, they
would be baffled, not but what he has got some teeth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
but they are pretty scatterin’. But still that Becon
shines, that pure love triumphs over lost teeth and vanished
sandy hair. There haint a man on the face of
the earth that looks so good to me as Josiah Allen. I
don’t tell him this, mind you, 14 years experience of
married life has taught me caution. Josiah is as good
as they’ll average generally, but no man can’t stand
too much flattery, men are naturally vain.</p>

<p class="caption">I AND JOSIAH.</p>
</div>

<p>As I said in the commencement of this plain and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
unvarnished history, I had almost a deadly objection
to widowers owin’ to their habit of comparin’ their
second wives to their first relict, to the disadvantage
of the first-named pardner. Josiah tride it with me
when we was first married. But I <em>didn’t encourage
him in it</em>. He began on several various times, “It
seems to me Samantha that Polly Ann used to fry up
her meat a little cripsier,” or “It seems as if Polly
Ann used to make my collers a little stiffer.” He
stopped it before we had been married a year, for <em>I
didn’t encourage it in him</em>.</p>

<p>As I mean that this book shall be a Becon light,
guidin’ female wimmen, to life, liberty, and the pursuit
of true happiness, I would insert right here this word
of solem’ warnin’ to my sect situated in the tryin’
place of second consorts, if the relict goes to comparin’
you to his foregone consort, <em>don’t encourage him in it</em>.
On this short rule hangs the hope of domestick harmony.</p>

<h2 id="ABOUT_JOSIAH_AND_THE_CHILDREN">ABOUT JOSIAH AND THE CHILDREN.</h2>

<p>But step-mothers have a pretty hard row to hoe,
though I don’t complain. I like children, clean
children first rate, and I have tried to do my duty by
his’en. I have done as well by ’em as I knew how to, and
I think a sight of Thomas Jefferson and Tirzah Ann.
Tirzah Ann is dreadful sentimental, that is what spiles
her mostly. And Thomas Jefferson thinks he knows
more than his father, that is his greatest failin’. But
take ’em all through, they are <em>full</em> as good as other
folks’es children, and I know it. Thomas Jefferson is
dreadful big feelin’, he is 17 years old, he wears a stove
pipe hat, and is tryin’ to raise a moustache, it is now
jest about as long as the fuzz on cotton flannel and
most as white. They both go to Jonesville to high
school, (we hire a room for ’em to Mother Allen’s, and
they board themselves,) but they are to home every
Saturday, and then they kinder quarell all day jest as
brothers and sisters will. What agravates Thomas J.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the worst is to call him “bub,” and Tirzah Ann
don’t call him anything else unless she forgets
herself.</p>

<p>He seems to think it is manly to have doubts about
religeon. I put him through the catechism, and thought
he was sound. But he seems to think it is manly to
argue about free moral agency, foreordination, and predestination,
and his father is jest fool enough to argue
with him. Sez he last Saturday,</p>

<p>“Father, if it was settled beyond question six or
seven thousand years ago that I was goin’ to be lost
what good does it do for me to squirm? and if it was
settled that I was goin’ to be saved, how be I goin’ to
help myself?” sez he, “I believe we can’t help ourselves,
what was meant to happen, will happen.”</p>

<p>Before his father had time to speak&mdash;Josiah is a slow
spoken man, Tirzah Ann spoke up&mdash;</p>

<p>“Bub, if it was settled six or seven thousand years
ago that I should take your new jockey club and hair
oil, and use ’em all myself, why then I shall.”</p>

<p>“Tirzah Ann,” says he “If you should touch ’em it
was foreordained from creation that you would get
dreadfully hurt.” But I spoke up then for the first
time, says I,</p>

<p>“You see Thomas J. that come to fighting you
have moral agency enough&mdash;or immoral agency.
Now,” says I, “I won’t hear another word from
you, you Thomas J. are a young fool, and you Josiah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Allen are a old one, now,” says I “go to the barn,
for I want to mop.”</p>

<p>Tirzah Ann as I said is dreadful sentimental, I don’t
know which side she took it from, though I mistrust
that Josiah if he had any encouragement would act
spoony. I am not the woman to encourage any kind
of foolishness. I remember when we was first engaged,
he called me “a little angel.” I jest looked
at him calmly and says I,</p>

<p>“I weigh two hundred and 4 pounds,” and he didn’t
call me so again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">TIRZAH ANN.</p>
</div>

<p>No! sentiment aint my style, and I abhor all kinds of
shams and deceitfulness. Now to the table you don’t
ketch me makin’ excuses. I should feel as mean as
pusley if I did. Though once in a while when I have
particuler company, and my cookin’ turns out bad, I
kinder turn the conversation on to the sufferin’s of our
four fathers in the Revolution, how they eat their katridge
boxes and shoe leather. It don’t do us no hurt
to remember their sufferin’s, and after talkin’ about
eatin’ shoe leather most any kind of cake seems tender.</p>

<p>I spose that life runs along with Josiah and the children
and me about as easy as it does with most men
and female wimmen. We have got a farm of 75 acres
of land all paid for. A comfortable story and a half
yeller house&mdash;good barns, and a bran new horse barn,
and health. Our door yard is large and shady with
apple, and pear, and cherry trees; and Tirzah Ann has
got posy beds under the winders that look first rate.
And where there haint no posy beds nor shade trees,
the grass grows smooth and green, and it is a splendid
place to dry clothes. On the north side of the house
is our orchard, the trees grow clear up to our kitchen
winder, and when the north door is open in the spring
of the year, and I stand there ironin’, the trees all covered
with pink blows it is a pleasant sight. But a still
pleasanter sight is it in the fall of the year to stand in
the door and see Josiah and Thomas Jefferson pickin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
up barells of the great red and yeller grafts at a dollar
a bushel. Beyond the orchard down a little bit of a
side hill runs the clear water of the canal. In front
of the house towards the south&mdash;but divided from it
by a good sized door yard and a picket fence, runs the
highway, and back of the house, if I do say it that
ortn’t to, there is as good a garden as there is in these
parts. For I set my foot down in the first ont, that I
<em>would</em> have garden sass of all kinds, and strawberrys,
and gooseberrys, and currant, and berry bushes, and
glad enough is Josiah now to think that he heard to
me. It took a little work of course, but I believe in
havin’ things good to eat, and so does Josiah. That
man has told me more’n a hundred times sense that
“of all the sass that ever was made, garden sass was
the best sass.” To the south of the house is our big
meadow&mdash;the smell of the clover in the summer is as
sweet as anything, our bees get the biggest part of their
honey there, the grass looks beautiful wavin’ in the
sunshine, and Josiah cut from it last summer 4 tons
of hay to the acre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="AN_UNMARRIED_FEMALE">AN UNMARRIED FEMALE.</h2>

<p>I suppose we are about as happy as the most of
folks, but as I was sayin’, a few days ago to Betsy
Bobbet a neighborin’ female of ours&mdash;“Every Station
house in life has its various skeletons. But we ort to try
to be contented with that spear of life we are called on to
handle.” Betsey haint married and she don’t seem to
be contented. She is awful opposed to wimmen’s rights,
she thinks it is wimmen’s only spear to marry, but as
yet she can’t find any man willin’ to lay holt of that
spear with her. But you can read in her daily life and
on her eager willin’ countenance that she fully realizes
the sweet words of the poet, “while there is life there
is hope.”</p>

<p>Betsey haint handsome. Her cheek bones are high,
and she bein’ not much more than skin and bone they
show plainer than they would if she was in good order.
Her complexion (not that I blame her for it) haint
good, and her eyes are little and sot way back in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
head. Time has seen fit to deprive her of her hair and
teeth, but her large nose he has kindly suffered her to
keep, but she has got the best white ivory teeth money
will buy; and two long
curls fastened behind
each ear, besides frizzles
on the top of her
head, and if she wasn’t
naturally bald, and
if the curls was the
color of her hair they
would look well. She
is awful sentimental,
I have seen a good
many that had it bad,
but of all the sentimental creeters I ever did see Betsey
Bobbet is the sentimentalest, you couldn’t squeeze
a laugh out of her with a cheeze press.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;" id="illus5">
<img src="images/illus5.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BETSEY BOBBET.</p>
</div>

<p>As I said she is awful opposed to wimmin’s havein’
any right only the right to get married. She holds on
to that right as tight as any single woman I ever see
which makes it hard and wearin’ on the single men
round here. For take the men that are the most opposed
to wimmin’s havin’ a right, and talk the most
about its bein’ her duty to cling to man like a vine to
a tree, they don’t want Betsey to cling to them, they
<em>won’t let</em> her cling to ’em. For when they would be
a goin’ on about how wicked it was for wimmin to vote&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
it was her only spear to marry, says I to ’em
“Which had you ruther do, let Betsey Bobbet cling
to you or let her vote?” and they would every one of
’em quail before that question. They would drop their
heads before my keen grey eyes&mdash;and move off the
subject.</p>

<p>But Betsey don’t get discourajed. Every time I see
her she says in a hopeful wishful tone, “That the deepest
men of minds in the country agree with her in
thinkin’ that it is wimmin’s duty to marry, and not to
vote.” And then she talks a sight about the retirin’
modesty and dignity of the fair sect, and how shameful
and revoltin’ it would be to see wimmen throwin’
’em away, and boldly and unblushin’ly talkin’ about
law and justice.</p>

<p>Why to hear Betsey Bobbet talk about wimmin’s
throwin’ their modesty away you would think if they
ever went to the political pole, they would have to
take their dignity and modesty and throw ’em against
the pole, and go without any all the rest of their
lives.</p>

<p>Now I don’t believe in no such stuff as that, I think
a woman can be bold and unwomanly in other things
besides goin’ with a thick veil over her face, and a brass
mounted parasol, once a year, and gently and quietly
dropping a vote for a christian president, or a religeous
and noble minded pathmaster.</p>

<p>She thinks she talks dreadful polite and proper, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
says “I was cameing” instead of “I was coming,” and
“I have saw” instead of “I have seen,” and “papah”
for paper, and “deah” for dear. I don’t know much
about grammer, but common sense goes a good ways.
She writes the poetry for the Jonesville Augur, or
“Augah,” as she calls it. She used to write for the
opposition paper, the Jonesville Gimlet, but the editer
of the Augur, a long haired chap, who moved into
Jonesville a few months ago, lost his wife soon after
he come there, and sense that she has turned Dimocrat,
and writes for his paper stiddy. They say that he is
a dreadful big feelin’ man, and I have heard&mdash;it came
right straight to me&mdash;his cousin’s wife’s sister told it
to the mother in law of one of my neighbor’s brother’s
wife, that he didn’t like Betsey’s poetry at all, and all
he printed it for was to plague the editer of the Gimlet,
because she used to write for him. I myself wouldn’t
give a cent a bushel for all the poetry she can write.
And it seems to me, that if I was Betsey, I wouldn’t
try to write so much, howsumever, I don’t know what
turn I should take if I was Betsey Bobbet, that is a
solemn subject and one I don’t love to think on.</p>

<p>I never shall forget the first piece of her poetry I
ever see. Josiah Allen and I had both on us been
married goin’ on a year, and I had occasion to go to
his trunk one day where he kept a lot of old papers,
and the first thing I laid my hand on was these verses.
Josiah went with her a few times after his wife died,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
a 4th of July or so and two or three camp meetin’s,
and the poetry seemed to be wrote about the time <em>we</em>
was married. It was directed over the top of it “Owed
to Josiah,” just as if she were in debt to him. This
was the way it read.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>I showed the poetry to Josiah that night after he
came home, and told him I had read it. He looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
awful ashamed to think I had seen it, and says he with
a dreadful sheepish look,</p>

<p>“The persecution I underwent from that female can
never be told, she fairly hunted me down, I hadn’t no
rest for the soles of my feet. I thought one spell she
would marry me in spite of all I could do, without
givin’ me the benefit of law or gospel.” He see I
looked stern, and he added with a sick lookin’ smile,
“I thought one spell, to use Betsey’s language, ‘I was
a gonah.’”</p>

<p>I didn’t smile&mdash;oh no, for the deep principle of my
sect was reared up&mdash;I says to him in a tone cold
enough to almost freeze his ears, “Josiah Allen, shet
up, of all the cowardly things a man ever done, it is
goin’ round braggin’ about wimmen’ likin’ em, and
follerin’ em up. Enny man that’ll do that is little
enough to crawl through a knot hole without rubbing
his clothes.” Says I, “I suppose you made her think
the moon rose in your head, and set in your heels, I
dare say you acted foolish enough round her to sicken
a snipe, and if you make fun of her now to please me
I let you know you have got holt of the wrong individual.”
Now, says I, “go to bed,” and I added in still
more freezing accents, “for I want to mend your pantaloons.”
He gathered up his shoes and stockin’s and
started off to bed, and we haint never passed a word
on the subject sence. I believe when you disagree
with your pardner, in freein’ your <em>mind</em> in the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
on’t, and then not be a twittin’ about it afterwards.
And as for bein’ jealous, I should jest as soon think of
bein’ jealous of a meetin’-house as I should of Josiah.
He is a well principled man. And I guess he wasn’t
fur out o’ the way about Betsey Bobbet, though I
wouldn’t encourage him by lettin’ him say a word on
the subject, for I always make it a rule to stand up for
my own sect; but when I hear her go on about the
editor of the Augur, I can believe anything about
Betsey Bobbet. She came in here one day last week,
it was about ten o’clock in the mornin’. I had got my
house slick as a pin, and my dinner under way, (I was
goin’ to have a biled dinner, and a cherry puddin’
biled, with sweet sass to eat on it,) and I sot down to
finish sewin’ up the breadth of my new rag carpet. I
thought I would get it done while I hadn’t so much
to do, for it bein’ the first of March, I knew sugarin’
would be comin’ on, and then cleanin’ house time, and
I wanted it to put down jest as soon as the stove was
carried out in the summer kitchen. The fire was
sparklin’ away, and the painted floor a shinin’ and the
dinner a bilin’, and I sot there sewin’ jest as calm as a
clock, not dreamin’ of no trouble, when in came Betsey
Bobbet.</p>

<p>I met her with outward calm, and asked her to set
down and lay off her things. She sot down, but she
said she couldn’t lay off her things. Says she, “I was
comin’ down past, and I thought I would call and let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
you see the last numbah of the Augah, there is a piece

<p class="caption">READING POETRY.</p>

<p>She handed me the paper, folded so I couldn’t see
nothin’ but a piece of poetry by Betsey Bobbet. I
see what she wanted of me and so I dropped my
breadths of carpetin’ and took hold of it and began to
read it.</p>

<p>“Read it audible if you please,” says she, “Especially
the precious remahks ovah it, it is such a feast for
me to be a sitting, and heah it reheahsed by a musical
vorce.”</p>

<p>Says I, “I spose I can rehearse it if it will do you
any good,” so I began as follers:</p>

<p>“It is seldem that we present to the readers of the
Augur (the best paper for the fireside in Jonesville or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the world) with a poem like the following. It may be
by the assistance of the Augur (only twelve shillings
a year in advance, wood and potatoes taken in exchange)
the name of Betsey Bobbet will yet be carved
on the lofty pinnacle of fame’s towering pillow. We
think however that she could study such writers as
Sylvanus Cobb, and Tupper with profit both to herself
and to them.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Editor of the Augur.</span>”</p>

<p>Here Betsey interrupted me, “The deah editah of
the Augah had no need to advise me to read Tuppah,
for he is indeed my most favorite authar, you have devorhed
him havn’t you Josiah Allen’s wife?”</p>

<p>“Devoured who?” says I, in a tone pretty near as
cold as a cold icicle.</p>

<p>“Mahten, Fahyueah, Tuppah, that sweet authar,”
says she.</p>

<p>“No mom,” says I shortly, “I hain’t devoured Martin
Farquhar Tupper, nor no other man, I hain’t a
cannibal.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you understand me not, I meant, devorhed
his sweet, tender lines.”</p>

<p>“I hain’t devoured his tenderlines, nor nothin’ relatin’
to him,” and I made a motion to lay the paper
down, but Betsey urged me to go on, and so I read.</p>

<p>“What think you of it?” says she as I finished readin’.</p>

<p>I looked right at her most a minute with a majestic
look. In spite of her false curls, and her new
white ivory teeth, she is a humbly critter. I looked
at her silently while she sot and twisted her long yeller
bunnet strings, and then I spoke out,</p>

<p>“Hain’t the Editor of the Augur a widower with a
pair of twins?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says she with a happy look.</p>

<p>Then says I, “If the man hain’t a fool, he’ll think
you are one.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” says she, and she dropped her bunnet strings,
and clasped her long bony hands together in her brown
cotton gloves, “oh, we ahdent soles of genious, have
feelin’s, you cold, practical natures know nuthing of,
and if they did not gush out in poetry we should expiah.
You may as well try to tie up the gushing catarack
of Niagarah with a piece of welting cord, as to
tie up the feelings of an ahdent sole.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ardent sole!” says I coldly. “Which makes the
most noise, Betsey Bobbet, a three inch brook or a ten
footer? which is the tearer? which is the roarer? deep
waters run stillest. I have no faith in feelin’s that
stalk round in public in mournin’ weeds. I have no
faith in such mourners,” says I.</p>

<p>“Oh Josiah’s wife, cold, practical female being, you
know me not; we are sundered as fah apart as if you
was sitting on the North pole, and I was sitting on the
South pole. Uncongenial being, you know me not.”</p>

<p>“I may not know you, Betsey Bobbet, but I do
know decency, and I know that no munny would
tempt me to write such stuff as that poetry and send
it to a widower, with twins.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” says she, “what appeals to the tendah feeling
heart of a single female woman more, than to see
a lonely man who has lost his relict? And pity never
seems so much like pity as when it is given to the deah
little children of widowehs. And,” says she, “I think
moah than as likely as not, this soaring soul of genious
did not wed his affinity, but was united to a weak
women of clay.”</p>

<p>“Mere women of clay!” says I, fixin’ my spektacles
upon her in a most searchin’ manner, “where will you
find a woman, Betsey Bobbet, that hain’t more or less
clay? and affinity, that is the meanest word I ever
heard; no married woman has any right to hear it.
I’ll excuse you, bein’ a female, but if a man had said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
it to me, I’d holler to Josiah. There is a time for
everything, and the time to hunt affinity is before you
are married; married folks hain’t no right to hunt it,”
says I sternly.</p>

<p>“We kindred souls soah above such petty feelings,
we soah fah above them.”</p>

<p>“I hain’t much of a soarer,” says I, “and I don’t
pretend to be, and to tell you the truth,” says I, “I
am glad I hain’t.”</p>

<p>“The Editah of the Augah,” says she, and she grasped
the paper off’en the stand and folded it up, and presented
it at me like a spear, “the Editah of this paper
is a kindred soul, he appreciates me, he undahstands
me, and will not our names in the pages of this very
papah go down to posterety togathah?”</p>

<p>Then says I, drove out of all patience with her, “I
wish you was there now, both of you, I wish,” says I,
lookin’ fixedly on her, “I wish you was both of you in
posterity now.”</p>

<h2 id="HAVING_MY_PICTURE_TOOK">HAVING MY PICTURE TOOK.</h2>

<p>The very next Saturday after I had this conversation
with Betsey, I went down to Jonesville to have my
picture took, Tirzah Ann bein’ to home so she could
get dinner for the menfolks. As for me I don’t set a
great deal of store by pictures, but Josiah insisted and
the children insisted, and I went. Tirzah Ann wanted
me to have my hair curled, but there I was firm, I
give in on the handkerchief pin, but on the curl business,
there I was rock.</p>

<p>Mr. Gansey the man that takes pictures was in another
room takin’ some, so I walked round the aunty
room, as they call it, lookin’ at the pictures that hang
up on the wall, and at the people that come in to have
theirs took. Some of ’em was fixed up dreadful; it
seemed to me as if they tried to look so that nobody
wouldn’t know whose pictures they was, after they
was took. Some of ’em would take off their bunnets
and gaze in the lookin’-glass at themselves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
try to look smilin’, and get an expression onto their
faces that they never owned.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;" id="illus8">
<img src="images/illus8.jpg" width="250" height="475" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PREPARING FOR A PICTURE.</p>
</div>

<p>In one corner of the room was a bewrow, with a lookin’-glass
and hair brushes onto it, and before it stood
a little man dreadful dressed up, with long black hair
streamin’ down over his coat coller, engaged in pouring
a vial of oil onto his head, and brushing his hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
with one of the brushes. I knew him in a minute,
for I had seen him come into the meetin’ house.
Afterwards when I was jest standin’ before the picture
of a dreadful harmless lookin’ man&mdash;he looked meek
enough to make excuses to his shadder for goin’ before
it, and I was jest sayin’ to myself, “There is a man
who would fry pancakes without complainin’,” I heard
a voice behind me sayin’,</p>

<p>“So the navish villian stalks round yet in decent
society.”</p>

<p>I turned round imegiately and see the little man,
who had got through fixin’ his hair to have his pictur
took, standin’ before me.</p>

<p>“Who do you mean?” says I calmly. “Who is
stalkin’ round?”</p>

<p>“The Editor of the Gimlet,” says he, “whose vile
image defiles the walls of this temple of art, the haunt
of Aglia, Thalia, and Euphrosine.”</p>

<p>“Who?” says I glancin’ keenly at him over my
specks, “the haunt of who?”</p>

<p>Says he “The daughters of Bachus and Venus.”</p>

<p>Says I “I don’t know anything about Miss Bachus,
nor the Venus girls,” and says I with spirit, “if they
are any low creeters I don’t thank you for speakin’ of
’em to me, nor Josiah won’t neether. This room belongs
to Jeremiah Gansey, and he has got a wife, a
likely woman, that belongs to the same meetin’ house
and the same class that I do, and he haint no business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to have other girls hauntin’ his rooms. If there is
anything wrong goin’ on I shall tell Sister Gansey.”</p>

<p>Says he “Woman you mistake, I meant the Graces.”</p>

<p>“Graces!” says I scornfully, “what do I care for
their graces. Sister Gansey had graces enough when
he married her,” says I. “That is jest the way, a man
will marry a woman jest as pretty as a new blown rose,
and then when she fades herself out, till she looks more
like a dead dandyline than a livin’ creeter, cookin’ <em>his</em>
vittles, washin’ <em>his</em> dishes, and takin’ care of <em>his</em> children;
then he’ll go to havin’ other girls hauntin’ him,
there haint no gospel in it,” says I.</p>

<p>I looked him keenly in the face all the time I spoke,
for I thought he was kinder’ upholdin’ Sister Gansey’s
husband, and I wanted my words to apaul him, but I
suppose he made a mistake, and thought I was admirin’
of him I looked so earnest at him, for he spoke up
and says he,</p>

<p>“I see by your stiddy glance that you have discovered
who I be. Yes Madam, you see before you the
Editor of the Augur, but don’t be nervous, don’t let it
affect you more than you can help, I am a mortal like
yourself.”</p>

<p>I looked at him with my most majestic look, and he
continued.</p>

<p>“The masses who devoured my great work ‘Logical
Reveries on the Beauties of Slavery,’ are naturally
anxious to see me. I don’t wonder at it, not at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>I was austerely silent and withdrawed to a winder
and set down. But he followed me and continued
on.</p>

<p>“That tract as you are doubtless aware, was written
just before the war, and a weaker minded man might
have been appalled by the bloodshed that followed its
publication. But no! I said calmly, it was written on
principle, and if it did bring ruin and bloodshed on
the country, principle would in the end prevail. The
war turned out different from what I hoped, chains
broke that I could have wept to see break&mdash;but still I
hung on to principle. Might I ask you Madam, exactly
what your emotions were when you read ‘Logical Reveries’
for the first time? I suppose no President’s
message was ever devoured as that was.”</p>

<p>“I never see nor heard of your ‘Logical Reveries,’”
says I coldly. “And thank fortune nobody can accuse
me of ever touchin’ a President’s message&mdash;unless they
belie me.”</p>

<p>He rolled up his eyes toward the cielin’ and sithed
hevily, and then says he, “Is it possible that in this
enlightened community there is still such ignorance
amongst the masses. I have got a copy in my pocket,
I never go without one. And I will read it to you
and it may be pleasant for you to tell your children
and grandchildren in the future, that the author of
“Logical Reveries on the Beauties of Slavery” told
you with his own lips, how the great work came to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
written. A poem was sent me intended as a satire on
the beautiful and time hallowed system of slavery, it
was a weak senseless mass of twaddle, but if the author
could have foreseen the mighty consequences that flowed
from it, he might well have trembled, for senseless
as it was it roused the lion in me, and I replied. I
divided my great work into two parts, first, that slavery
was right, because the constitution didn’t say it was
wrong, and then I viewed the subject in a Bible and
moral light, but the last bein’ of less importance, of
course I didn’t enlarge on it, but on the first I come
out strong, there I shone. I will read you a little of
the poem that was sent me, that you may understand
the witherin’ allusions I make concernin’ it. I won’t
read more than is necessary for that purpose, for you
may get sleepy listenin’ to it, but you will wake up
enough when I begin to read the “Logical Reveries,”
I guess there couldn’t anybody sleep on them. The
poem I speak of commenced in the following weak
illogical way.</p>

<p>Jest as he arrived to this crysis in the poem, Mr.
Gansey came out into the aunty room, and told me he
was ready to take my picture. The Editer seein’ he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
was obleeged to stop readin’ told me, he would come
down to our house a visitin’ in sugarin’ time, and finish
readin’ the poetry to me. I ketched holt of my
principles to stiddy ’em, for I see they was a totterin’
and says to him with outward calmness,</p>

<p>“If you come fetch the twins.”</p>

<p>He said he would. I then told Mr. Gansey I was
ready for the picture. I believe there haint nothin’
that will take the expression out of anybody’s eyes,
like havin’ poetry
read for a hour and a
half, unless it is to
have your head screwed
back into a pair of
tongs, and be told to
look at nothin’ and
wink at it as much as
you are a mind to.
Under both of these
circumstances, it didn’t
suprise me a mite
that one of my eyes
was took blind. But as Mr. Gansey said as he looked
admirin’ly on it, with the exception of that one blind
eye, it was a perfect and strikin’ picture. I paid him
his dollar and started off home, and I hope now that
Josiah and the children will be satisfied.</p>

<h2 id="OUR_SURPRIZE_PARTIES">OUR SURPRIZE PARTIES.</h2>

<p>About one week after this picture eppysode, there
was a surprise party appointed. They had been
havin’ ’em all winter, and the children had been crazy
to have me go to ’em&mdash;everybody went, old and young,
but I held back. Says I: “I don’t approve of ’em,
and I won’t go.”</p>

<p>But finally they got their father on their side; says
he: “It won’t hurt you Samantha, to go for once.”</p>

<p>Says I: “Josiah, the place for old folks is to home;
and I don’t believe in surprise parties anyway, I think
they are perfect nuisances. It stands to reason if you
want to see your friends, you can invite ’em, and if
anybody is too poor to bake a cake or two, and a pan
of cookies, they are too poor to go into company at
all.” Says I: “I haint proud, nor never was called
so, but I don’t want Tom, Dick and Harry, that I
never spoke to in my life, feel as if they was free to
break into my house at any time they please.” Says
I: “it would make me feel perfectly wild, to think
there was a whole drove of people, liable to rush in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
here at any minute, and I won’t rush into other people’s
housen.”</p>

<p>“It would be fun, mother,” says Thomas J.; “I
should love to see you and Deecon Gowdey or old
Bobbet, playin’ wink ’em slyly.”</p>

<p>“Let ’em wink at me if they dare to,” says I
sternly; “let me catch ’em at it. I don’t believe in
surprise parties,” and I went on in about as cold a
tone as they make. “Have you forgot how Mrs.
Gowdey had her parlor lamp smashed to bits, and a
set of stun china? Have you forgot how four or five
stranger men got drunk to Peedicks’es, and had to be
carried up stairs and laid out on her spare bed? Have
you forgot how Celestine Wilkins fell with her baby
in her arms, as she was catchin’ old Gowdey, and
cracked the little innocent creeter’s nose? Have you
forgot how Betsey Bobbet lost out her teeth a runnin’
after the editor of the Augur, and he stepped on ’em
and smashed ’em all to bits? Have you forgot these
coincidences?” Says I: “I don’t believe in surprise
parties.”</p>

<p>“No more do I,” says Josiah; “but the children
feel so about our goin’, sposen’ we go, for once! No
livin’ woman could do better for children than you
have by mine, Samantha, but I don’t suppose you feel
exactly as I do about pleasin’ ’em, it haint natteral
you should.”</p>

<p>Here he knew he had got me. If ever a woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
wanted to do her duty by another woman’s children,
it is Samantha Allen, whose maiden name was Smith.
Josiah knew jest how to start me; men are deep. I
went to the very next party, which was to be held
two miles beyond Jonesville; they had had ’em so
fast, they had used up all the nearer places. They
had heard of this family, who had a big house, and
the women had been to the same meetin’ house
with Betsey Bobbet two or three times, and she had
met her in a store a year before, and had been introduced
to her, so she said she felt perfectly free to go.
And as she was the leader it was decided on. They
went in two big loads, but Josiah and I went in a cutter
alone.</p>

<p>We got started ahead of the loads, and when we got
to the house we see it was lit up real pleasant, and a
little single cutter stood by the gate. We went up to
the door and knocked, and a motherly lookin’ woman
with a bunch of catnip in her hand, came to the door.</p>

<p>“Good evenin’,” says I, but she seemed to be a little
deaf, and didn’t answer, and I see, as we stepped
in, through a door partly open, a room full of women.</p>

<p>“Good many have got here,” says I a little louder.</p>

<p>“Yes, a very good doctor,” says she.</p>

<p>“What in the world!”&mdash;I begun to say in wild
amaze.</p>

<p>“No, it is a boy.”</p>

<p>I turned right round, and laid holt of Josiah; says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
I, “Start this minute, Josiah Allen, for the door.” I
laid holt of him, and got him to the door, and we never
spoke another word till we was in the sleigh, and turned
round towards home; then says I,</p>

<p>“Mebby you’ll hear to <em>me</em>, another time, Josiah.</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t be so agravatin’,” says he.</p>

<p>Jest then we met the first load, where Tirzah Ann
and Thomas Jefferson was, and we told ’em to “turn
round, for they couldn’t have us, they had other company.”
So they turned round. We had got most
back to Jonesville, when we met the other load; they
had tipped over in the snow, and as we drove out most
to the fence to get by ’em, Josiah told ’em the same
we had the other load.</p>

<p>Says Betsey Bobbet, risin’ up out of the snow with
a buffalo skin on her back, which made her look wild,</p>

<p>“Did they say we <em>must not</em> come?”</p>

<p>“No, they didn’t say jest that,” says Josiah. “But
they don’t want you.”</p>

<p>“Wall then, my deah boys and girls,” says she,
scramblin’ into the sleigh. “Let us proceed onwards,
if they did not say we <em>should not</em> come.”</p>

<p>Her load went on, for her brother, Shakespeare
Bobbet, was the driver. How they got along I haint
never enquired, and they don’t seem over free to talk
about it. But they kep’ on havin’ ’em, most every
night. Betsey Bobbet as I said was the leader, and
she led ’em once into a house where they had the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
pox, and once where they was makin’ preparations for
a funeral. Somehow Tirzah and Thomas Jefferson
seemed to be sick of ’em, and as for Josiah, though he
didn’t say much, I knew he felt the more.</p>

<p>This coinsidense took place on Tuesday night, and
the next week a Monday I had had a awful day’s work
a washin’, and we had been up all night the night before
with Josiah, who had the new ralegy in his back.
We hadn’t one of us slept a wink the night before, and
Thomas Jefferson and Tirzah Ann had gone to bed
early. It had been a lowery day, and I couldn’t hang
out my calico clothes, and so many of ’em was hung
round the kitchen on lines and clothes bars, and nails,
that Josiah and I looked as if we was a settin’ in a wet
calico tent. And what made it look still more melancholy
and sad, I found when I went to light the lamp,
that the kerosene was all gone, and bein’ out of candles,
I made for the first time what they call a “slut,”
which is a button tied up in a rag, and put in a saucer
of lard; you set fire to the rag, and it makes a light
that is better than no light at all, jest as a slut is better
than no woman at all; I suppose in that way it derived
its name. But it haint a dazzlin’ light, nothin’ like
so gay and festive as gas.</p>

<p>I, beat out with work and watchin’, thought I would
soak my feet before I went to bed, and so I put some
water into the mop pail, and sot by the stove with my
feet in it. The thought had come to me after I got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
my night-cap on. Josiah sot behind the stove, rubbin’
some linament onto his back; he had jest spoke to me,
and says he,</p>

<p>“I believe this linament makes, my back feel easier,
Samantha, I hope I shall get a little rest to-night.”</p>

<p>Says I, “I hope so too, Josiah.” And jest as I said
the words, without any warning the door opened, and
in come what seemed to me at the time to be a hundred
and 50 men, wimmen, and children, headed by
Betsey Bobbet.</p>

<p>Josiah, so wild with horror and amazement that he
forgot for the time bein’ his lameness, leaped from his
chair, and tore so wildly at his shirt that he tore two
pieces right out of the red flannel, and they shone on
each shoulder of his white shirt like red stars; he then
backed up against the wall between the back door and
the wood box. I rose up and stood in the mop pail,
too wild with amaze to get out of it, for the same reason
heedin’ not my night-cap.</p>

<p>“We have come to suprize you,” says Betsey Bobbet,
sweetly.</p>

<p>I looked at ’em in speechless horror, and my tongue
clove to the roof of my mouth; no word did I speak,
but I glared at ’em with looks which I suppose filled
’em with awe and dread, for Betsey Bobbet spoke again
in plaintive accents,</p>

<p>“Will you not let us suprize you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Then I found voice, and “No! no!” says I wildly.
“I won’t be suprized! you sha’n’t suprize us to-night!
We won’t be suprized! Speak, Josiah,” says I, appealin’
to him in my extremity. “Speak! tell her!
will we be suprized to-night?”</p>

<p>“No! no!” says he in firm, decided, warlike tones,
as he stood backed up against the wall, holdin’ his
clothes on&mdash;with his red flannel epaulettes on his shoulders
like a officer, “no, we won’t be suprized!”</p>

<p>“You see, deah friends,” says she to the crowd,
“she will not let us suprize her, we will go.” But
she turned at the door, and says she in reproachful accents,
“May be it is right and propah to serve a old
friend and neighbah in this way&mdash;I have known you a
long time, Josiah Allen’s wife.”</p>

<p>“I have known you plenty long enough,” says I,
steppin’ out of the pail, and shettin’ the door pretty
hard after ’em.</p>

<p>Josiah came from behind the stove pushin’ a chair
in front of him, and says he,</p>

<p>“Darn suprize parties, and darn&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t swear, Josiah, I should think you was bad
enough off without swearin’&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I <em>will</em> darn Betsey Bobbet, Samantha. Oh, my
back!” he groaned, settin’ down slowly, “I can’t set
down nor stand up.”</p>

<p>“You jumped up lively enough, when they come
in,” says I.</p>

<p>“Throw that in my face, will you? What could I
du? And there is a pin stickin’ into my shoulder, do
get it out, Samantha, it has been there all the time,
only I haint sensed it till now.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” says I in a kinder, soothin tone, drawin’ it
out of his shoulder, where it must have hurt awfully,
only he hadn’t felt it in his greater troubles&mdash;“Less
be thankful that we are as well off as we be. Betsey
might have insisted on stopin’. I will rub your shoulders
with the linament, and I guess you will feel better;
do you suppose they will be mad?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, nor I don’t care, but I hope so,”
says he.</p>

<p>And truly his wish come to pass, for Betsey was
real mad; the rest didn’t seem to mind it. But she
was real short to me for three days. Which shows it
makes a difference with her who does the same thing,
for they went that night right from here to the Editor
of the Augur’s. And it come straight to me from
Celestine Wilkins, who was there, that he turned ’em
out doors, and shet the door in their faces.</p>

<p>The way it was, his hired girl had left him that
very day, and one of the twins was took sick with
wind colic. He had jest got the sick baby to sleep,
and laid it in the cradle, and had gin the little well
one some playthings, and set her down on the carpet,
and he was washin’ the supper dishes, with his shirt
sleeves rolled up, and a pink bib-apron on that belonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to his late wife. They said he had jest finished, and
was wringin’ out his dishcloth, when he heard a awful
screamin’ from the well twin, and he rushed out with
his dishcloth hangin’ over his arm, and found that she
had swallowed a side-thimble; he ketched her up, and
spatted her back, and the thimble flew out half way
across the floor. She screamed, and held her breath,
and the sick one waked up, and sot up in the cradle
and screamed fearfully, and jest then the door bust
open, and in come the suprize party headed by Betsey
Bobbet. They said that he, half crazy as he was, told
Betsey that “if she didn’t head ’em off that minute,
he would prosecute the whole of ’em.” Some of ’em
was mad about it, he acted so threat’nin’, but Betsey
wasn’t, for in the next week’s Augur these verses
came out:</p>

<h2 id="A_DAY_OF_TROUBLE">A DAY OF TROUBLE.</h2>

<p>Sugerin’ time come pretty late this year, and I
told Josiah, that I didn’t believe I should have a
better time through the whole year, to visit his folks, and
mother Smith, than I should now before we begun to
make sugar, for I knew no sooner had I got that out
of the way, than it would be time to clean house,
and make soap. And then when the dairy work
come on, I knew I never should get off. So I went.
But never shall I forget the day I got back. I had
been gone a week, and the childern bein’ both off to
school, Josiah got along alone. I have always said,
and I say still, that I had jest as lives have a roarin’
lion do my house-work, as a man. Every thing that
could be bottom side up in the house, was.</p>

<p>I had a fortnight’s washin’ to do, the house to clean
up, churnin’ to do, and bakin’; for Josiah had eat up
everything slick and clean, the buttery shelves looked
like the dessert of Sarah. Then I had a batch of
maple sugar to do off, for the trees begun to run after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
I went away and Josiah had syruped off&mdash;and some
preserves to make, for his folks had gin me some
pound sweets, and they was a spilein’. So it seemed
as if everything come that day, besides my common
house-work&mdash;and well doth the poet say&mdash;“That a
woman never gets her work done up,” for she don’t.</p>

<p>Now when a man ploughs a field, or runs up a line
of figgers, or writes a serming, or kills a beef critter,
there it is done&mdash;no more to be done over. But sposen’
a woman washes up her dishes clean as a fiddle,
no sooner does she wash ’em up once, than she has to,
right over and over agin, three times three hundred
and 65 times every year. And the same with the
rest of her work, blackin’ stoves, and fillin’ lamps,
and washin’ and moppin’ floors, and the same with
cookin’. Why jest the idee of paradin’ out the table
and tea-kettle 3 times 3 hundred and 65 times every
year is enough to make a woman sweat. And then to
think of all the cookin’ utensils and ingredients&mdash;why
if it wuzzn’t for principle, no woman could stand the
idee, let alone the labor, for it haint so much the mussle
she has to lay out, as the strain on her mind.</p>

<p>Now last Monday, no sooner did I get my hands
into the suds holt of one of Josiah’s dirty shirts, than
the sugar would mount up in the kettle and sozzle
over on the top of the furnace in the summer kitchen&mdash;or
else the preserves would swell up and drizzle
over the side of the pan on to the stove&mdash;or else the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
puddin’ I was a bakin’ for dinner would show signs of
scorchin’, and jest as I was in the heat of the warfare,
as you may say, who should drive up but the Editor
of the Agur. He was a goin’ on further, to engage a
hired girl he had hearn of, and on his way back, he
was goin’ to stop and read that poetry, and eat some
maple sugar; and he wanted to leave the twins till
he come back.</p>

<p>Says he, “They won’t be any trouble to you, will
they?” I thought of the martyrs, and with a appearance
of outward composure, I answered him in a sort
of blind way; but I won’t deny that I had to keep a
sayin’, ‘John Rogers! John Rogers’ over to myself
all the time I was ondoin’ of ’em, or I should have
said somethin’ I was sorry for afterwards. The poetry
woried me the most, I won’t deny.</p>

<p>After the father drove off, the first dive the biggest
twin made was at the clock, he crep’ up to that,
and broke off the pendulum, so it haint been since,
while I was a hangin’ thier cloaks in the bedroom.
And while I was a puttin’ thier little oversocks under
the stove to dry, the littlest one clim’ up and sot down
in a pail of maple syrup, and while I was a wringin’
him out, the biggest one dove under the bed, at Josiah’s
tin trunk where he keeps a lot of old papers, and
come a creepin’ out, drawin’ it after him like a hand-sled.
There was a gography in it, and a Fox’es book
of martyrs, and a lot of other such light reading, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
I let the twins have ’em to recreate themselves on,
and it kep’ ’em still most a minute.</p>

<p>I hadn’t much more’n got my eye off’en that Fox’es
book of Martyrs&mdash;when there appeared before ’em a
still more mournful sight, it was Betsey Bobbet come
to spend the day.</p>

<p>I murmured dreamily to myself “John Rogers”&mdash;But
that didn’t do, I had to say to myself with firmness&mdash;“Josiah
Allen’s wife, haint you ashamed of
yourself, what are your sufferin’s to John Rogers’es?
Think of the agony of that man&mdash;think of his 9 children
follerin’ him, and the one at the breast, what are
your sufferin’s compared to his’en?” Then with a
brow of calm I advanced to meet her. I see she had
got over bein’ mad about the surprise party, for she
smiled on me once or twice, and as she looked at the
twins, she smiled 2 times on each of ’em, which made
4 and says she in tender tones,</p>

<p>“You deah little motherless things.” Then she
tried to kiss ’em. But the biggest one gripped her by
her false hair, which was flax, and I should think by a
careless estimate, that he pulled out about enough to
make half a knot of thread. The little one didn’t do
much harm, only I think he loosened her teeth a little,
he hit her pretty near the mouth, and I thought as
she arose she slipped ’em back in thier place. But she
only said,</p>

<p>“Sweet! sweet little things, how ardent and impulsive
they are, so like thier deah Pa.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>She took out her work, and says she, “I have come
to spend the day. I saw thier deah Pa bringin’ the
deah little twins in heah, and I thought maybe I
could comfort the precious little motherless things
some, if I should come over heah. If there is any
object upon the earth, Josiah Allen’s wife, that appeals
to a feelin’ heart, it is the sweet little children of widowers.
I cannot remember the time when I did not
want to comfort them, and thier deah Pa’s. I have
always felt that it was woman’s highest speah, her
only mission to soothe, to cling, to smile, to coo. I
have always felt it, and for yeahs back it has been a
growin’ on me. I feel that you do not feel as I do in
this matter, you do not feel that it is woman’s greatest
privilege, her crowning blessing, to soothe lacerations,
to be a sort of a poultice to the noble, manly breast
when it is torn with the cares of life.”</p>

<p>This was too much, in the agitated frame of mind I
then was.</p>

<p>“Am I a poultice Betsey Bobbet, do I look like
one?&mdash;am I in the condition to be one?” I cried turnin’
my face, red and drippin’ with prespiration towards
her, and then attacked one of Josiah’s shirt sleeves
agin. “What has my sect done,” says I, as I wildly
rubbed his shirt sleeves, “That they have got to be
lacerator soothers, when they have got everything else
under the sun to do?” Here I stirred down the preserves
that was a runnin’ over, and turned a pail full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of syrup into the sugar kettle. “Everybody says that
men are stronger than women, and why should they
be treated as if they was glass china, liable to break
all to pieces if they haint handled careful. And if
they have got to be soothed,” says I in an agitated
tone, caused by my emotions (and by pumpin’ 6 pails
of water to fill up the biler), “Why don’t they get
men to sooth’em? They have as much agin time as
wimmen have; evenin’s they don’t have anything else
to do, they might jest as well be a soothin’ each other
as to be a hangin’ round grocery stores, or settin’ by
the fire whittlin’.”</p>

<p>I see I was frightenin’ her by my delerious tone and
I continued more mildly, as I stirred down the strugglin’
sugar with one hand&mdash;removed a cake from the
oven with the other&mdash;watched my apple preserves
with a eagle vision, and listened intently to the voice
of the twins, who was playin’ in the woodhouse.</p>

<p>“I had jest as soon soothe lacerations as not, Betsey,
if I hadn’t everything else to do. I had jest as
lives set down and smile at Josiah by the hour, but
who would fry him nut-cakes? I could smoothe
down his bald head affectionately, but who would do
off this batch of sugar? I could coo at him day in
and day out, but who would skim milk&mdash;wash pans&mdash;get
vittles&mdash;wash and iron&mdash;and patch and scour&mdash;and
darn and fry&mdash;and make and mend&mdash;and bake and bile
while I was a cooin’, tell me?” says I.</p>

<p>Betsey spoke not, but quailed, and I continued&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Women haint any stronger than men, naturally;
thier backs and thier nerves haint made of any stouter
timber; their hearts are jest as liable to ache as men’s
are; so with thier heads; and after doin’ a hard day’s
work when she is jest ready to drop down, a little
smilin’ and cooin’ would do a woman jest as much
good as a man. Not what,” I repeated in the firm
tone of principle “Not but what I am willin’ to coo,
if I only had time.”</p>

<p>A pause enshued durin’ which I bent over the wash-tub
and rubbed with all my might on Josiah’s shirt
sleeve. I had got one sleeve so I could see streaks of
white in it, (Josiah is awful hard on his shirt sleeves),
and I lifted up my face and continued in still more
reesonable tones, as I took out my rice puddin’ and
cleaned out the bottom of the oven, (the pudden had
run over and was a scorchin’ on), and scraped the
oven bottom with a knife,</p>

<p>“Now Josiah Allen will go out into that lot,” says
I, glancein’ out of the north window “and plough
right straight along, furrow after furrow, no sweat of
mind about it at all; his mind is in that free calm state
that he could write poetry.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of poetry, reminds me,” said Betsey, and
I see her hand go into her pocket; I knew what was
a comin’, and I went on hurriedly, wavin’ off what I
knew must be, as long as I could. “Now, I, a workin’
jest as hard as he accordin’ to my strength, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
havin’ to look 40 ways to once, and 40 different strains
on my mind, now tell me candidly, Betsey Bobbet,
which is in the best condition for cooin’, Josiah Allen
or me? but it haint expected of him,” says I in agitated
tones, “I am expected to do all the smilin’ and
cooin’ there is done, though you know,” says I sternly,
“that I haint no time for it.”</p>

<p>“In this poem, Josiah Allen’s wife, is embodied
my views, which are widely different from yours.”</p>

<p>I see it was vain to struggle against fate, she had the
poetry in her hand. I rescued the twins from beneath
a half a bushel of beans they had pulled over onto
themselves&mdash;took off my preserves which had burnt
to the pan while I was a rescuin’, and calmly listened
to her, while I picked up the beans with one hand,
and held off the twins with the other.</p>

<p>“There is one thing I want to ask your advice
about, Josiah Allen’s wife. This poem is for the
Jonesville Augah. You know I used always to write
for the opposition papah, the Jonesville Gimlet, but
as I said the othah day, since the Editah of the
Augah lost his wife I feel that duty is a drawing of
me that way. Now do you think that it would be
any more pleasing and comforting to that deah Editah
to have me sign my name Bettie Bobbet&mdash;or Betsey,
as I always have?” And loosin’ herself in thought
she murmured dreamily to the twins, who was a pullin’
each other’s hair on the floor at her feet&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sweet little mothahless things, you couldn’t tell
me, could you, deahs, how your deah Pa would feel
about it?”</p>

<p>Here the twins laid holt of each other so I had to
part ’em, and as I did so I said to Betsey, “If you
haint a fool you will hang on to the Betsey. You
can’t find a woman nowadays that answers to her true
name. I expect,” says I in a tone of cold and almost
witherin’ sarcasm, “that these old ears will yet hear
some young minister preach about Johnnie the Baptist,
and Minnie Magdalen. Hang on to the Betsey;
as for the Bobbet,” says I, lookin’ pityingly on her,
“that will hang on for itself.”</p>

<p>I was too well bread to interrupt her further, and I
pared my potatoes, pounded my beefsteak, and ground
my coffee for dinner, and listened. This commenced
also as if she had been havin’ a account with Love,
and had come out in his debt.</p>

<p>There was pretty near twenty verses of ’em, and as
she finished she said to me&mdash;</p>

<p>“What think you of my poem, Josiah Allen’s
wife?”</p>

<p>Says I, fixin’ my sharp grey eyes upon her keenly,
“I have had more experience with men than you
have, Betsey;” I see a dark shadow settlin’ on her
eye-brow, and I hastened to apologise&mdash;“you haint
to blame for it, Betsey&mdash;we all know you haint to
blame.”</p>

<p>She grew calm, and I proceeded, “How long do
you suppose you could board a man on clear smiles,
Betsey&mdash;you jest try it for a few meals and you’d find
out. I have lived with Josiah Allen 14 years, and I
ought to know somethin’ of the natur of man, which
is about alike in all of ’em, and I say, and I contend
for it, that you might jest as well try to cling to a bear
as to a hungry man. After dinner, sentiment would
have a chance, and you might smile on him. But
then,” says I thoughtfully, “there is the dishes to
wash.”</p>

<p>Jest at that minute the Editor of the Augur stopped
at the gate, and Betsey, catchin’ up a twin on each
arm, stood up to the winder, smilin’.</p>

<p>He jumped out, and took a great roll of poetry out
from under the buggy seat&mdash;I sithed as I see it. But
fate was better to me than I deserved. For Josiah
was jest leadin’ the horse into the horse barn, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the Editor happened to look up and see Betsey. Josiah
says he swore&mdash;says he “the d&mdash;&mdash;!” I won’t
say what it was, for I belong to the meetin’ house, but
it wasn’t the Deity though it begun with a D. He
jumped into the buggy agin, and says Josiah,</p>

<p>“You had better stay to dinner, my wife is gettin’
a awful good one&mdash;and the sugar is most done.”</p>

<p>Josiah says he groaned, but he only said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Fetch out the twins.”</p>

<p>Says Josiah, “You had better stay to dinner&mdash;you
haint got no women folks to your house&mdash;and I know
what it is to live on pancakes,” and wantin’ to have a
little fun with him, says he, “Betsey Bobbet is here.”</p>

<p>Josiah says he swore agin, and agin says he, “fetch
out the twins.” And he looked so kind o’ wild and
fearful towards the door, that Josiah started off on the
run.</p>

<p>Betsey was determined to carry one of the twins
out, but jest at the door he tore every mite of hair
off’en her head, and she, bein’ bald naturally, dropped
him. And Josiah carried ’em out, one on each arm,
and he drove off with ’em fast. Betsey wouldn’t stay
to dinner all I could do and say, she acted mad. But
one sweet thought filled me with such joyful emotion
that I smiled as I thought of it&mdash;I shouldn’t have to
listen to any more poetry that day.</p>

<h2 id="THE_MINISTERS_BEDQUILT">THE MINISTER’S BEDQUILT.</h2>

<p>The Baptists in our neighborhood have been piecen’
up a bedquilt for their minister. He has preached
considerable, and held a Sunday school to our school-house,
and I wasn’t goin’ to have any bedquilts done
for him without havin’ my hand in it to help it along.
I despise the idee of folks bein’ so sot on their own
meetin’ housen. Thier is enough worldly things for
neighbors to fight about, such as hens, and the school-marm,
without takin’ what little religion they have
got and go to peltin’ each other with it.</p>

<p>Sposen’ Baptists do love water better’n they do dry
land? What of it? If my Baptist brethren feel any
better to baptise thierselves in the Atlantic ocian, it
haint none of my business. Somehow Josiah seems
to be more sot onto his own meetin’ house than I do.
Thomas Jefferson said when we was a arguin’ about
it the mornin’ of the quiltin’, says he, “The more
water the better,” says he, “it would do some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
brethren good to put ’em asoak and let ’em lay over
night.”</p>

<p>I shet him up pretty quick, for I will not countenance
such light talk&mdash;but Josiah laughed, he encourages
that boy in it, all I can do and say.</p>

<p>I always make a pint of goin’ to quiltin’s any way,
whether I go on Methodist principle (as in this case)
or not, for you can’t be backbited to your face, that is
a moral certainty. I know women jest like a book,
for I have been one quite a spell. I always stand up
for my own sect, still I know sartin effects foller sartin
causes. Such as two bricks bein’ sot up side by
side, if one tumbles over on to the other, the other
can’t stand up, it haint natur. If a toper holds a
glass of liquor to his mouth he can’t help swallowin’
it, it haint nater. If a young man goes out slay-ridin’
with a pretty girl, and the buffalo robe slips off,
he can’t help holdin’ it round her, it haint nater. And
quiltin’ jest sets women to slanderin’ as easy and beautiful
as any thing you ever see. I was the first one
there, for reasons I have named; I always go early.</p>

<p>I hadn’t been there long before Mrs. Deacon Dobbins
came, and then the Widder Tubbs, and then
Squire Edwards’es wife and Maggie Snow, and then
the Dagget girls. (We call ’em <em>girls</em>, though it would
be jest as proper to call mutton, lamb.)</p>

<p>Miss Wilkins’ baby had the mumps, and the Peedicks
and Gowdey’s had unexpected company. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
with Miss Jones where the quiltin’ was held, and her
girls Mary Ann and Alzina, we made as many as could
get round the quilt handy.</p>

<p>The quilt was made of different kinds of calico; all
the women round had pieced up a block or two, and
we took up a collection to get the battin’ and linin’
and the cloth to set it together with, which was turkey
red, and come to quilt it, it looked well. We quilted
it herrin’ bone, with a runnin’ vine round the border.</p>

<p>After the pathmaster was demorilized, the school-teacher
tore to pieces, the party to Peedicks scandalized,
Sophronia Gowdey’s charicter broke doun&mdash;and
her mother’s new bunnet pronounced a perfect fright,
and twenty years too young for her&mdash;and Miss Wilkins’
baby voted a unquestionable idiot, and the rest
of the unrepresented neighborhood dealt with, Lucinda
Dagget spoke up and says she&mdash;</p>

<p>“I hope the minister will like the bedquilt.” (Lucinda
is the one that studies mathematics to harden
her mind, and has the Roman nose.)</p>

<p>“It haint no ways likely he will,” says her sister
Ophelia; (she is the one that frizzles her hair on top
and wears spectacles.) “It haint no ways likely he
will&mdash;for he is a cold man, a stun statute.”</p>

<p>Now you see I set my eyes by that minister, if he
is of another persuasion. He is always doin’ good to
somebody, besides preachin’ more like a angel than a
human bein’. I can’t never forget&mdash;and I don’t want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to&mdash;how he took holt of my hand, and how his voice
trembled and the tears stood in his eyes, when we
thought our Tirzah Ann was a dyin’&mdash;she was in his
Sunday School class. There is some lines in your life
you can’t rub out, if you try to ever so hard. And I
wasn’t goin’ to set still and hear him run down. It
riled up the old Smith blood, and when that is riled,
Josiah says he always feels that it is best to take his
hat and leave, till it settles. I spoke right up and
says I&mdash;</p>

<p>“Lucky for him he was made of stun before he was
married, for common flesh and blood would have gin’
out a hundred times, chaste round by the girls as he
was.” You see it was the town talk, how Ophelia
Dagget acted before he was married, and she almost
went into a decline, and took heaps of motherwort
and fetty.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean, Miss Allen,” says
she, turnin’ red as a red brick, “I never heard of his
bein’ chaste, I knew I never could bear the sight of
him.”</p>

<p>“The distant sight,” says Alzina Jones.</p>

<p>Ophelia looked so mad at that, that I don’t know
but she would have pricked her with her quiltin’
needle, if old Miss Dobbins hadn’t spoke up. She is
a fat old lady, with a double chin, mild and lovely
as Mount Vernon’s sister. She always agrees with
everybody. Thomas Jefferson calls her “Woolen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Apron” for he says he heard her one day say to Miss
Gowdy&mdash;“I don’t like woolen aprons, do you Miss
Gowdy?”</p>

<p>“Why yes, Miss Dobbin, I do.”</p>

<p>“Well so do I,” says she. But good old soul, if we
was all such peace makers as she is, we should be
pretty sure of Heaven. Though Thomas Jefferson
says, “if Satan should ask her to go to his house, she
would go, rather than hurt his feelin’s.” That boy
worrys me, I don’t know what he is a comin’ to.</p>

<p>As I said, she looked up mildly over her spectacles,
and nodded her purple cap ribbons two or three times,
and said “yes,” “jest so,” to both of us. And then
to change the subject says she;</p>

<p>“Has the minister’s wife got home yet?”</p>

<p>“I think not,” says Maggie Snow. “I was to the
village yesterday, and she hadn’t come then.”</p>

<p>“I suppose her mother is well off,” says the Widder
Tubbs, “and as long as she stays there, she saves
the minister five dollars a week, I should think she
would stay all summer.” The widder is about as
equinomical a woman as belongs to his meetin’ house.</p>

<p>“It don’t look well for her to be gone so long,”
says Lucinda Dagget, “I am very much afraid it will
make talk.”</p>

<p>“Mebby it will save the minister five dollars a
week,” says Ophelia, “as extravagant as she is in
dress, as many as four silk dresses she has got, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
there’s Baptist folks as good as she is that hain’t got but
one&mdash;and one certain Baptist person <em>full</em> as good as
she is that hain’t got any.” (Ophelia’s best dress is
poplin.) “It won’t take her long to run out the minister’s
salary.”</p>

<p>“She had her silk dresses before she was married,
and her folks were wealthy,” says Mrs. Squire Edwards.</p>

<p>“As much as we have done for them, and are still
doing,” says Lucinda, “it seems ungrateful in her to
wear such a bunnet as she wore last summer, a plain
white straw, with a little bit of ribbon onto it, not
a flower nor a feather, it looked so scrimped and stingy,
I have thought she wore it on purpose to mortify
us before the Methodists. Jest as if we couldn’t afford
to dress our minister’s wife as well as they did
theirs.”</p>

<p>Maggie Snow’s cheeks was a getting as red as fire,
and her eyes began to shine, jest as they did that day
she found some boys stonein’ her kitten. She and the
minister’s wife are the greatest friends that ever was.
And I see she couldn’t hold in much longer. She
was jest openin’ her mouth to speak, when the door
opened and in walked Betsey Bobbet.</p>

<p>“My! it seems to me you are late, Betsey, but walk
right into the spare bedroom, and take off your
things.”</p>

<p>“Things!” says Betsey, in a reckless tone, “who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
cares for things!” And she dropped into the nearest
rocking chair and commenced to rock herself violently
and says she “would that I had died when I was a infant
babe.”</p>

<p>“Amen!” whispered Alzina Jones, to Maggie
Snow.</p>

<p>Betsey didn’t hear her, and again she groaned out,
“Would that I had been laid in yondeh church yard,
before my eyes had got open to depravity and wickedness.”</p>

<p>“Do tell us what is the matter Betsey,” says Miss
Jones.</p>

<p>“Yes do,” says Miss Deacon Dobbins.</p>

<p>“Matter enuff,” says she, “No wondeh there is
earthquakes and jars. I heard the news jest as I
came out of our gate, and it made me weak as a cat, I
had to stop to every house on the way doun heah, to
rest, and not a soul had heard of it, till I told ’em.
Such a shock as it gave me, I shant get over it for a
week, but it is just as I always told you, I always said
the minister’s wife wasn’t any <em>too</em> good. It didn’t
surprise me not a bit.”</p>

<p>“You can’t tell me one word against Mary Morton
that I’ll believe,” says Maggie Snow.</p>

<p>“You will admit that the minister went North last
Tuesday, won’t you.”</p>

<p>Seven wimmin spoke up at once and said: “Yes,
his mother was took sick, and telegraphed for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“So he said,” said Betsey Bobbet, “so he said, but
I believe it is for good.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear,” shrieked Ophelia Dagget, “I shall faint
away, ketch hold of me, somebody.”</p>

<p>“Ketch hold of yourself,” says I coolly, and then
says I to Betsey, “I don’t believe he has run away no
more than I believe that I am the next President of
the United States.”</p>

<p>“Well, if he is not, he will wish he had, his wife
come home this morning on the cars.”</p>

<p>Four wimmens said “Did she,” two said, “Do tell,”
and three opened their mouths and looked at her
speechless. Amongst these last was Miss Deacon
Dobbins. But I spoke out in a collected manner,
“What of it?”</p>

<p>Says she, “I believe the poor, deah man mistrusted
it all out and run away from trouble and disgrace
brought upon him by that female, his wife.”</p>

<p>“How dare you speak the word disgrace in connection
with Mary Morton?” says Maggie Snow.</p>

<p>“How dare I?” says Betsey. “Ask Thomas Jefferson
Allen, as it happened, I got it from his own
mouth, it did not come through two or three.”</p>

<p>“Got what?” says I, and I continued in pretty cold
tones, “If you can speak the English language, Betsey
Bobbet, and have got sense enough to tell a straight
story, tell it and be done with it,” says I. “Thomas
Jefferson has been to Jonesville ever sense mornin’.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says she, “and he was coming home, jest as
I started for heah, and he stopped by our gate, and
says he, ‘Betsey, I have got something to tell you. I
want to tell it to somebody that can keep it, it ought
to be kept,’ says he; and then he went on and told;
says he,&mdash;‘The minister’s wife has got home, and she
didn’t come alone neither.’</p>

<p>“Says I, what do you mean? He looked as mysterious
as a white ghost, and says he, ‘I mean what I
say.’ Says he, ‘I was in the men’s room at the depot
this morning, and I heard the minister’s wife in the
next room talking to some body she called Hugh, you
know her husband’s name is Charles. I heard her
tell this Hugh that she loved him, loved him better
than the whole world;’ and then he made me promise
not to tell, but he said he heerd not only one kiss, but
fourteen or fifteen.</p>

<p>“Now,” says Betsey, “what do you think of that
female?”</p>

<p>“Good Heavens!” cried Ophelia Dagget, “am I deceived?
is this a phantagory of the brain? have I got
ears? have I got ears?” says she wildly, glaring at me.</p>

<p>“You can feel and see,” says I pretty short.</p>

<p>“Will he live with the wretched creature?” continued
Ophelia, “no he will get a divorcement from her,
such a tender hearted man too, as he is, if ever a man
wanted a comforter in a tryin’ time, he is the man,
and to-morrow I will go and comfort him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Methinks you will find him first,” says Betsey
Bobbet. “And after he is found, methinks there is a
certain person he would be as glad to see as he would
another certain person.”</p>

<p>“There is some mistake,” says Maggie Snow.
“Thomas Jefferson is always joking,” and her face
blushed up kinder red as she spoke about Thomas J.</p>

<p>I don’t make no matches, nor break none, but I watch
things pretty keen, if I don’t say much.</p>

<p>“It was a male man,” says Lucinda Dagget, “else
why did she call him Hugh? You have all heerd Elder
Morton say that his wife hadn’t a relative on earth,
except a mother and a maiden aunt. It couldn’t have
been her mother, and it couldn’t have been the maiden
aunt, for her name was Martha instead of Hugh;
besides,” she continued, (she had so hardened her mind
with mathematics that she could grapple the hardest
fact, and floor it, so to speak,) “besides, the maiden
aunt died six months ago, that settles the matter conclusively,
it was not the maiden aunt.”</p>

<p>“I have thought something was on the Elders’ mind,
for quite a spell, I have spoke to sister Gowdy about
it a number of times,” then she kinder rolled up her
eyes just as she does in conference meetin’s, and says
she, “it is an awful dispensation, but I hope he’ll turn
it into a means of grace, I hope his spiritual strength
will be renewed, but I have borryed a good deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
trouble about his bein’ so handsome, I have noticed
handsome ministers don’t turn out well, they most always
have somethin’ happen to ’em, sooner or later,
but I hope he’ll be led.”</p>

<p>“I never thought that Miss Morton was any
too good.”</p>

<p>“Neither did I,” said Lucinda Dagget.</p>

<p>“She has turned out jest as I always thought she
would,” says Ophelia, “and I think jest as much of
her, as I do of them that stand up for her.” Maggie
Snow spoke up then, jest as clear as a bell her voice
sounded. She hain’t afraid of anybody, for she is
Lawyer Snow’s only child, and has been to Boston to
school. Says she “Aunt Allen,” she is a little related
to me on her mother’s side. “Aunt Allen, why is it
as a general rule, the worst folks are the ones to suspect
other people of bein’ bad.”</p>

<p>Says I, “Maggy, they draw their pictures from
memery, they think, ‘now if <em>I</em> had that opportunity to
do wrong, I should certainly improve it&mdash;and so of
course <em>they</em> did.’ And they want to pull down other
folks’es reputations, for they feel as if their own goodness
is in a totterin’ condition, and if it falls, they
want somethin’ for it to fall on, so as to come down
easier like.”</p>

<p>Maggy Snow laughed, and so did Squire Edwards’
wife, and the Jones’es&mdash;but Betsey Bobbet, and the
Dagget girls looked black as Erobius. And says Betsey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Bobbet to me, “I shouldn’t think, Josiah Allen’s
wife, that <em>you</em> would countenance such conduct.”</p>

<p>“I will first know that there is wrong conduct,”
says I&mdash;“Miss Morton’s face is just as innocent as a
baby’s, and I hain’t a goin’ to mistrust any evil out of
them pretty brown eyes, till I am obleeged to.”</p>

<p>“Well, you will have to believe it,” says Ophelia
Dagget&mdash;“and there shall be somethin’ done about it as
sure as my name is Ophelia Dagget.”</p>

<p>“Let him that is without sin amongst you cast the
first stone,” says Miss Squire Edwards&mdash;a better Baptist
women never lived than she is.</p>

<p>“Yes,” says I in almost piercen’ tones, “which of
us is good enough to go into the stun business? Even
supposin’ it was true, which I never will believe on
earth, which of us could stun her on gospel grounds?&mdash;who
will you find that is free from all kind of sin?”
and as I spoke, remorseful thoughts almost knocked
against my heart, how I had scolded Josiah the night
before for goin’ in his stockin feet.</p>

<p>“I never see a female women yet that I thought was
perfect, and yet how willin’ they are to go to handlin’
these stuns&mdash;why wimmen fling enough stuns at each
other every day, to make a stun wall that would reach
from pole to pole.”</p>

<p>Just at this minute the hired girl come in, and said
supper was on the table, and we all went out to eat
it. Miss Jones said there wasn’t anything on the table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
fit to eat, and she was afraid we couldn’t make out&mdash;but
it was a splendid supper, fit for the Zaar of
Rushy.</p>

<p>We hadn’t more’n got up from the supper table, and
got back into the parlor, when we heard a knock onto
the front door, and Miss Jones went and opened it,
and who of all the live world should walk in but the
minister! The faces of the wimmen as he entered would
have been a study for Michael Angelico, or any of them
old painters. Miss Jones was that flustrated that she
asked him the first thing to take his bunnet off, and
then she bethought herself, and says she, ‘How’s your
Ma?’ before she had sat him a chair or anything. But
he looked as pleasant and composed as ever, though
his eyes kinder laughed. And he thanked her and
told her he left his mother the day before a good deal
better, and then he turned to Maggy Snow, and says
he,</p>

<p>“I have come after you Miss Maggy, my wife come
home this mornin’ and was so anxious to see you that
I told her as I had business past your house this afternoon,
I would call for you as I went home, and your
mother told me you were here. I think I know why
she wants to see you so very much now. She is so
proud of our boy, she can’t wait till&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Your boy,” gasped nine wimmen to once.</p>

<p>“Yes,” says he smilin’ more pleasant than I ever
seen him. “I know you will wish me joy, we have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
nice little boy, little Hugh, for my wife has named
him already for her father, he is a fine healthy little
fellow almost two months old.”</p>

<p>It wouldn’t have done no good for Michael Angelico
or Mr. Ruben, to have been there then, nor none of
the rest of them we read about, for if they had their
palates’es and easels’es all ready, they never could have
done justice to the faces of the Dagget girls, and Betsey
Bobbet. And as for Miss Deacon Dobbins, her
spectacles fell off unnoticed and she opened her mouth
so wide, it was very doubtful to me if she could ever
shut it again. Maggy Snow’s face shone like a Cherubim,
and as for me, I can truly say I was happy
enough to sing the Te Deus.</p>

<h2 id="A_ALLEGORY_ON_WIMMENS_RIGHTS">A ALLEGORY ON WIMMEN’S RIGHTS.</h2>

<p>About a couple of weeks after the quiltin’, Thomas
Jefferson said to Josiah, one Saturday mornin’,</p>

<p>“Father, can I have the old mare to go to Jonesville
to-night?”</p>

<p>“What do you want to go to Jonesville for?” said
his father, “you come from there last night.”</p>

<p>“There is goin’ to be a lecture on wimmin’s rights;
can I have her, father?”</p>

<p>“I s’pose so,” says Josiah, kinder short, and after
Thomas J. went out, Josiah went on&mdash;</p>

<p>“Wimmin’s rights, wimmin’s rights, I wonder how
many more fools are goin’ a caperin’ round the country
preachin’ ’em up&mdash;I am sick of wimmin’s rights, I
don’t believe in ’em.”</p>

<p>This riled up the old Smith blood, and says I to him
with a glance that went clear through to the back side
of his head&mdash;</p>

<p>“I know you don’t, Josiah Allen&mdash;I can tell a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
that is for wimmin’s rights as fur as I can see ’em.
There is a free, easy swing to thier walk&mdash;a noble look
to thier faces&mdash;thier big hearts and soles love liberty
and justice, and bein’ free themselves they want everybody
else to be free. These men haint jealous of a
woman’s influence&mdash;haint afraid that she won’t pay
him proper respect if she haint obleeged to&mdash;and they
needn’t be afraid, for these are the very men that wimmin
look up to, and worship,&mdash;and always will. A
good, noble, true man is the best job old natur ever
turned off her hands, or ever will&mdash;a man, that would
wipe off a baby’s tears as soft as a woman could, or
‘die with his face to the foe.’</p>

<p>“They are most always big, noble-sized men, too,”
says I, with another look at Josiah that pierced him
like a arrow; (Josiah don’t weigh quite one hundred
by the steelyards.)</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I am to blame, Samantha, for not
bein’ a very hefty man.”</p>

<p>“You can let your sole grow, Josiah Allen, by
thinkin’ big, noble-sized thoughts, and I believe if you
did, you would weigh more by the steelyards.”</p>

<p>“Wall, I don’t care, Samantha, I stick to it, that I
am sick of wimmin’s rights; if wimmin would take
care of the rights they have got now, they would do
better than they do do.”</p>

<p>Now I love to see folks use reason if they have got
any&mdash;and I won’t stand no importations cast on to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
sect&mdash;and so I says to him in a tone of cold and almost
freezin’ dignity&mdash;</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Josiah?”</p>

<p>“I mean that women hain’t no business a votin’;
they had better let the laws alone, and tend to thier
house-work. The law loves wimmin and protects
’em.”</p>

<p>“If the law loves wimmin so well, why don’t he
give her as much wages as men get for doin’ the same
work? Why don’t he give her half as much, Josiah
Allen?”</p>

<p>Josiah waved off my question, seemin’ly not noticin’
of it&mdash;and continued with the doggy obstinacy of
his sect&mdash;</p>

<p>“Wimmin haint no business with the laws of the
country.”</p>

<p>“If they haint no business with the law, the law
haint no business with them,” says I warmly. “Of
the three classes that haint no business with the law&mdash;lunatics,
idiots, and wimmin&mdash;the lunatics and idiots
have the best time of it,” says I, with a great
rush of ideas into my brain that almost lifted up the
border of my head-dress. “Let a idiot kill a man;
‘What of it?’ says the law; let a luny steal a sheep;
again the law murmurs in a calm and gentle tone,
‘What of it? they haint no business with the law and
the law haint no business with them.’ But let one of
the third class, let a woman steal a sheep, does the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
law soothe her in these comfortin’ tones? No, it thunders
to her, in awful accents, ‘You haint no business
with the law, but the law has a good deal of business
with you, vile female, start for State’s prisen; you
haint nothin’ at all to do with the law, only to pay all
the taxes it tells you to&mdash;embrace a license bill that is
ruinin’ your husband&mdash;give up your innocent little
children to a wicked father if it tells you to&mdash;and a
few other little things, such as bein’ dragged off to
prison by it&mdash;chained up for life, and hung, and et
cetery.’”</p>

<p>Josiah sot motionless&mdash;and in a rapped eloquence I
went on in the allegory way.</p>

<p>“‘Methought I once heard the words,’ sighs the female,
‘True government consists in the consent of the
governed;’ did I dream them, or did the voice of a luny
pour them into my ear?’</p>

<p>“‘Haint I told you,’ frouns the law on her, ‘that
that don’t mean wimmin&mdash;have I got to explain to
your weakened female comprehension again, the great
fundymental truth, that wimmin haint included and
mingled in the law books and statutes of the country
only in a condemnin’ and punishin’ sense, as it were.
Though I feel it to be bendin’ down my powerful
manly dignity to elucidate the subject further, I will
consent to remind you of the consolin’ fact, that though
you wimmin are, from the tender softness of your natures,
and the illogical weakness of your minds, unfit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
from ever havin’ any voice in makin’ the laws that
govern you; you have the right, and nobody can ever
deprive you of it, to be punished in a future world jest
as hard as a man of the strongest intellect, and to be
hung in this world jest as dead as a dead man; and
what more can you ask for, you unreasonable female
woman you?’</p>

<p>“Then groans the woman as the great fundymental
truth rushes upon her&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘I can be hung by the political rope, but I can’t
help twist it.’</p>

<p>“‘Jest so,’ says the law, ‘that rope takes noble and
manly fingers, and fingers of principle to twist it, and
not the weak unprincipled grasp of lunatics, idiots,
and wimmin.’</p>

<p>“‘Alas!’ sithes the woman to herself, ‘would that
I had the sweet rights of my wild and foolish companions,
the idiots and lunys. But,’ says she, venturing
with a beating heart, the timid and bashful inquiry,
‘are the laws always just, that I should obey them
thus implicitly? There is old Creshus, he stole two
millions, and the law cleared him triumphantly. Several
men have killed various other men, and the law
insistin’ they was out of their heads, (had got out of
’em for the occasion, and got into ’em agin the minute
they was cleared,) let ’em off with sound necks. And
I, a poor woman, have only stole a sheep, a small-sized
sheep too, that my offspring might not perish with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
hunger&mdash;is it right to liberate in a triumphin’ way the
two million stealer and the man murderer, and inkarcerate
the poor sheep stealer? and my children was <em>so</em>
hungry, and it was such a small sheep,’ says the woman
in pleadin’ accents.</p>

<p>“‘Idiots! lunatics! and wimmin! are they goin’ to
speak?’ thunders the law. ‘Can I believe my noble
right ear? can I bein’ blindfolded trust my seventeen
senses? I’ll have you understand that it haint no
woman’s business whether the laws are just or unjust,
all you have got to do is jest to obey ’em, so start off
for prison, my young woman.’</p>

<p>“‘But my house-work,’ pleads the woman; ‘woman’s
place is home: it is her duty to remain at all hazards
within its holy and protectin’ precincts; how can
I leave its sacred retirement to moulder in State’s
prison?’</p>

<p>“‘House-work!’ and the law fairly yells the words,
he is so filled with contempt at the idee. ‘House-work!
jest as if house-work is goin’ to stand in the
way of the noble administration of the law. I admit
the recklessness and immorality of her leavin’ that
holy haven, long enough to vote&mdash;but I guess she can
leave her house-work long enough to be condemned,
and hung, and so forth.’</p>

<p>“‘But I have got a infant,’ says the woman, ‘of tender
days, how can I go?’</p>

<p>“‘That is nothing to the case,’ says the law in stern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
tones. ‘The peculiar conditions of motherhood only
unfits a female woman from ridin’ to town with her
husband, in a covered carriage, once a year, and layin’
her vote on a pole. I’ll have you understand it is no
hindrance to her at all in a cold and naked cell, or in
a public court room crowded with men.’</p>

<p>“‘But the indelikacy, the outrage to my womanly
nature?’ says the woman.</p>

<p>“‘Not another word out of your head, young woman,’
says the law, ‘or I’ll fine you for contempt. I
guess the law knows what is indelikacy, and what
haint; where modesty comes in, and where it don’t;
now start for prison bareheaded, for I levy on your
bunnet for contempt of me.’</p>

<p>“As the young woman totters along to prison, is it
any wonder that she sithes to herself, but in a low
tone, that the law might not hear her, and deprive her
also of her shoes for her contemptas thoughts&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Would that I were a idiot; alas! is it not possible
that I may become even now a luny?&mdash;then I should
be respected.’”</p>

<p>As I finished my allegory and looked down from
the side of the house, where my eyes had been fastened
in the rapped eloquence of thought, I see Josiah with
a contented countenance, readin’ the almanac, and I
said to him in a voice before which he quailed&mdash;</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen, you haint heard a word I’ve said,
you know you haint.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes I have,” says he, shettin’ up the almanac; “I
heard you say wimmin ought to vote, and I say she
hadn’t. I shall always say that she is too fraguile, too
delikate, it would be too hard for her to go to the pole.”</p>

<p>“There is one pole you are willin’ enough I should
go to, Josiah Allen,” and I stopped allegorin’, and
spoke with witherin’ dignity and self respect&mdash;“and
that is the hop pole.” (Josiah has sot out a new hop
yard, and he proudly brags to the neighbors that I am
the fastest picker in the yard.) “You are willin’
enough I should handle them poles!” He looked smit
and conscience struck, but still true to the inherient
principles of his sect, and thier doggy obstinacy, he
murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>“If wimmin know when they are well off, they will
let poles and ’lection boxes alone, it is too wearin for
the fair sect.”</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen,” says I, “you think that for a woman
to stand up straight on her feet, under a blazin’
sun, and lift both her arms above her head, and pick
seven bushels of hops, mingled with worms and spiders,
into a gigantic box, day in, and day out, is awful
healthy, so strengthenin’ and stimulatin’ to wimmin,
but when it comes to droppin’ a little slip of clean paper
into a small seven by nine box, once a year in a
shady room, you are afraid it is goin’ to break down a
woman’s constitution to once.”</p>

<p>He was speechless, and clung to Ayer’s almanac
mechanically (as it were) and I continued&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is another pole you are willin’ enough for
me to handle, and that is our cistern pole. If you
should spend some of the breath you waste&mdash;in pityin’
the poor wimmin that have got to vote&mdash;in byin’ a
pump, you would raise 25 cents in my estimation, Josiah
Allen. You have let me pull on that old cistern
pole thirteen years, and get a ten quart pail of water
on to the end of it, and I guess the political pole
wouldn’t draw much harder than that does.”</p>

<p>“I guess I will get one, Samantha, when I sell the
old critter. I have been a calculatin’ to every year,
but things will kinder run along.”</p>

<p>“I am aware of that,” says I in a tone of dignity
cold as a lump of cold ice. “I am aware of that. You
may go into any neighborhood you please, and if there
is a family in it, where the wife has to set up leeches,
make soap, cut her own kindlin’ wood, build fires in
winter, set up stove-pipes, dround kittens, hang out
clothes lines, cord beds, cut up pork, skin calves, and
hatchel flax with a baby lashed to her side&mdash;I haint
afraid to bet you a ten cent bill, that that woman’s
husband thinks that wimmin are too feeble and delicate
to go the pole.”</p>

<p>Josiah was speechless for pretty near half a minute,
and when he did speak it was words calculated to draw
my attention from contemplatin’ that side of the subject.
It was for reasons, I have too much respect for
my husband to even hint at&mdash;odious to him, as odious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
could be&mdash;he wanted me to forget it, and in the gentle
and sheepish manner men can so readily assume
when they are talkin’ to females he said, as he gently
fingered Ayer’s almanac, and looked pensively at
the dyin’ female revivin’ at a view of the bottle&mdash;</p>

<p>“We men think too much of you wimmin to want
you to lose your sweet, dignified, retirin’ modesty that
is your chieftest charm. How long would dignity and
modesty stand firm before the wild Urena of public
life? You are made to be happy wives, to be guarded
by the stronger sect, from the cold blast and the torrid
zone. To have a fence built around you by manly
strength, to keep out the cares and troubles of life.
Why, if I was one of the fair sect, I would have a husband
to fence me in, if I had to hire one.”</p>

<p>He meant this last, about hirin’ a husband, as a joke,
for he smiled feebly as he said it, and in other and
happier times stern duty would have compelled me to
laugh at it&mdash;but not now, oh no, my breast was heavin’
with too many different sized emotions.</p>

<p>“You would hire one, would you? a woman don’t
lose her dignity and modesty a racin’ round tryin’ to
get married, does she? Oh no,” says I, as sarcastic
as sarcastic could be, and then I added sternly, “If it
ever does come in fashion to hire husbands by the
year, I know of one that could be rented cheap, if his
wife had the proceeds and avails in a pecuniary sense.”</p>

<p>He looked almost mortified, but still he murmur’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
as if mechanically. “It is wimmen’s place to marry
and not to vote.”</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen,” says I, “Anybody would think to
hear you talk that a woman couldn’t do but just one
of the two things any way&mdash;marry or vote, and had
got to take her choice of the two at the pint of the
bayonet. And anybody would think to hear you go
on, that if a women could live in any other way, she
wouldn’t be married, and you couldn’t get her to.”
Says I, looking at him shrewdly, “if marryin’ is such
a dreadful nice thing for wimmen I don’t see what
you are afraid of. You men act kinder guilty about
it, and I don’t wonder at it, for take a bad husband,
and thier haint no kind of slavery to be compared to
wife slavery. It is jest as natural for a mean, cowardly
man to want to abuse and tyranize over them
that they can, them that are dependent on ’em, as for
a noble and generous man to want to protect them
that are weak and in their power. Figurin’ accordin’
to the closest rule of arithmetic, there are at least one-third
mean, dissopated, drunken men in the world, and
they most all have wives, and let them tread on these
wives ever so hard, if they only tread accordin’ to law,
she can’t escape. And suppose she tries to escape,
blood-hounds haint half so bitter as public opinion on
a women that parts with her husband, chains and
handcuffs haint to be compared to her pride, and her
love for her children, and so she keeps still, and suffers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
agony enough to make four first class martyrs.
Field slaves have a few hours for rest at night, and a
hope, to kinder boy them up, of gettin’ a better master.
But the wife slave has no hope of a change of masters,
and let him be ever so degraded and brutal is at his
mercy day and night. Men seem to be awful afraid
that wimmen won’t be so fierce for marryin’ anybody,
for a home and a support, if they can support themselves
independent, and be jest as respectable in the
eyes of the world. But,” says I,</p>

<p>“In them days when men and wimmen are both
independent&mdash;free and equal, they will marry in the
only true way&mdash;from love and not from necessity. They
will marry because God will join their two hearts and
hands so you can’t get ’em apart no how. But to hear
you talk Josiah Allen, anybody would think that there
wouldn’t another woman marry on earth, if they could
get rid of it, and support themselves without it.” And
then I added, fixin’ my keen grey eyes upon his’en.
“You act guilty about it Josiah Allen. But,” says
I, “just so long as the sun shines down upon the earth
and the earth answers back to it, blowin’ all out full
of beauty&mdash;Jest so long as the moon looks down lovin’ly
upon old ocien makin’ her heart beat the faster,
jest so long will the hearts and souls God made for
each other, answer to each other’s call. God’s laws
can’t be repealed, Josiah Allen, they wasn’t made in
Washington, D. C.”</p>

<p>I hardly ever see a man quail more than he did, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to tell the truth, I guess I never had been quite so eloquent
in all the 14 years we had lived together&mdash;I felt
so eloquent that I couldn’t stop myself and I went on.</p>

<p>“When did you ever see a couple that hated each other,
or didn’t care for each other, but what their children,
was either jest as mean as pusley&mdash;or else wilted and
unhappy lookin’ like a potato sprout in a dark suller?
What that potato sprout wants is sunshine, Josiah Allen.
What them children wants is love. The fact is
love is what makes a home&mdash;I don’t care whether its
walls are white, stone, marble or bass wood. If there
haint a face to the winder a waitin’ for you, when you
have been off to the store, what good does all your
things do you, though you have traded off ten pounds
of butter? A lot of folks may get together in a big
splendid house, and be called by the same name, and
eat and sleep under the same roof till they die, and
call it home, but if love don’t board with ’em, give me
an umbrella and a stump. But the children of these
marriages that I speak of, when they see such perfect
harmony of mind and heart in their father and mother,
when they have been brought up in such a warm,
bright, happy home&mdash;they can’t no more help growin’
up sweet, and noble, and happy, than your wheat
can help growin’ up straight and green when the warm
rain and the sunshine falls on it. These children, Josiah
Allen, are the future men and wimmens who are
goin’ to put their shoulder blades to the wheel and
roll this world straight into millenium.” Says Josiah,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wimmen are too good to vote with us men, wimmen
haint much more nor less than angels any way.”</p>

<p>When you have been soarin’ in eloquence, it is always
hard to be brought down sudden&mdash;it hurts you
to light&mdash;and this speech sickened me, and says I,
in a tone so cold that he shivered imperceptibly.</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen, there is one angel that would be glad
to have a little wood got for her to get dinner with,
there is one angel that cut every stick of wood she
burnt yesterday, that same angel doin’ a big washin’
at the same time,” and says I, repeatin’ the words, as
I glanced at the beef over the cold and chilly stove,
“I should like a handful of wood Josiah Allen.”</p>

<p>“I would get you some this minute Samantha,” says
he gettin’ up and takin’ down his plantin’ bag, “but
you know jest how hurried I be with my spring’s
work, can’t you pick up a little for this forenoon? you
haint got much to do have you?”</p>

<p>“Oh no!” says I in a lofty tone of irony, “Nothin’
at all, only a big ironin’, ten pies and six loves of bread
to bake, a cheese curd to run up, 3 hens to scald,
churnin’ and moppin’ and dinner to get. Jest a easy
mornin’s work for a angel.”</p>

<p>“Wall then, I guess you’ll get along, and to-morrow
I’ll try to get you some.”</p>

<p>I said no more, but with lofty emotions surgin’ in
my breast, I took my axe and started for the wood-pile.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="A_AXIDENT">A AXIDENT.</h2>

<p>I have been sick enough with a axident. Josiah
had got his plantin’ all done, and the garden seeds was
comin’ up nice as a pin, I will have a good garden.
But the hens bothered me most to death, and kep’ me
a chasin’ out after ’em all the time. No sooner would
I get ’em off the peas, then they would be on the
mush mellons, and then the cowcumbers would take it
and then the string beans, and there I was rushin’ out
doors bareheaded all times of day. It was worse for
me than all my house work, and so I told Josiah.</p>

<p>One day I went out full sail after ’em, and I fell
kerslap over a rail that lay in the grass, and turned my
ancle jint, and I was laid up bed sick for two weeks.
It makes me out of patience to think of it, for we
might have a dog that is worth somethin’ if it wasn’t
for Josiah, but as it is, if he haint to the house I have
to do all the chasin’ there is done, for I might as well
get the door step started on to the cattle, or hens, as
to get our dog off of it, to go on to any thing.</p>

<p>And he is big as a young eliphant too, eats as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
as a cow, and of all the lazy critters I ever did see, he
is the cap sheaf. Why, when Josiah sets him on to
the hens, he has to take him by the collar and kinder
draws him along, all the way. And as for cows and
calves, he seems to be afraid of ’em, somethin’ kinder
constitutionel Josiah says. I tell him he might
better bark ’em off himself, especially as he is a first
rate hand at it, you can’t tell him from a dog when
he sets out.</p>

<p>One mornin’ I says to him, “Josiah Allen, what’s
the use of your keepin’ that pup?”</p>

<p>Says he “Samantha, he is a good feller, if I will
kinder run ahead of him, and keep between him and
the cows, he will go on to them first rate, he seems to
want encouragement.”</p>

<p>“Encouragement!” says I, “I should think as
much.”</p>

<p>I didn’t say no more, and that very day the axident
happened. Josiah heard me holler, and he come runnin’
from the barn&mdash;and a scairter man I never see.
He took me right up, and was carryin’ of me in. I
was in awful agony&mdash;and the first words I remember
sayin’ was these, in a faint voice.</p>

<p>“I wonder if you’ll keep that pup now?”</p>

<p>Says he firmly, yet with pity, and with pale and
anxious face.</p>

<p>“Mebby you didn’t encourage him enough.”</p>

<p>Says I deliriously, “Did you expect I was goin’ to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
carry him in my arms and throw him at the hens? I
tried every other way.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;" id="illus14">
<img src="images/illus14.jpg" width="375" height="175" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE AXIDENT.</p>
</div>

<p>“Wall, wall!” says he, kinder soothin’ly, “Do keep
still, how do you expect I’m goin’ to carry you if you
touse round so.”</p>

<p>He laid me down on the lounge in the settin’ room,
and I never got off of it, for two weeks. Fever set in&mdash;I
had been kinder unwell for quite a spell, but I
wouldn’t give up. I would keep ’round to work.
But this axident seemed to be the last hump on the
camel’s back, I had to give in, and Tirzah Ann had
to come home from school to do the work.</p>

<p>When the news got out that I was sick, lots of folks
came to see me. And every one wanted me to take
some different kinds of patented medicine, or herb
drink&mdash;why my stomach would have been drounded
out, a perfect wreck&mdash;if I had took half. And then
every one would name my desease some new name.
Why I told Josiah at the end of the week, that accordin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to their tell, I had got every desease under the
sun, unless it was the horse distemper.</p>

<p>One mornin’ Miss Gowdey came in, and asked me in
a melancholy way, if I had ever had the kind pox. I
told her I had.</p>

<p>“Well,” says she, “I mistrust you have got the
very oh Lord.”</p>

<p>It was a Saturday mornin’ and Thomas Jefferson
was to home, and he spoke up and said “that was a
good desease, and he hoped it would prevail; he knew
quite a number that he thought it would do ’em good
to have it.”</p>

<p>She looked real shocked, but knew it was some of
Thomas J.’s fun. There was one woman that would
come in, in a calm, quiet way about 2 times a week,
and say in a mild, collected tone,</p>

<p>“You have got the tizick.”</p>

<p>Says I, “the pain is in my foot mostly.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help that,” says she gently, but firmly,
“There is tizick with it. And I think that is what
ailed Josiah when he was sick.”</p>

<p>“Why,” says I, “that was the newraligy, the doctors
said.”</p>

<p>“Doctors are liable to mistakes,” says she in the
same firm but modest accents, “I have always thought
it was the tizick. There are more folks that are tiziky
than you think for, in this world. I am a master
hand for knowin’ it when I see it.” She would then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
in an affectionate manner advise me to doctor for the
tizick, and then she would gently depart.</p>

<p>There are 2 kinds of wimmen that go to see the
sick. There’s them low voiced, still footed wimmen,
that walks right in, and lays their hands on your hot
foreheads so soothin’ like, that the pain gets ashamed
of itself and sneaks off. I call ’em God’s angels.
Spozen they haint got wings, I don’t care, I contend
for it they are servin’ the Lord jest as much as if they
was a standin’ up in a row, all feathered out, with a
palm tree in one hand and a harp in the other.</p>

<p>So I told old Gowdey one cold winter day&mdash;(he is
awful stingy, he has got a big wood lot&mdash;yet lets lots
of poor families most freeze round him, in the winter
time. He will pray for ’em by the hour, but it don’t
seem to warm ’em up much)&mdash;he says to me,</p>

<p>“Oh! if I was only a angel! if I only had holt of
the palm tree up yonder that is waitin’ for me.”</p>

<p>Says I, coolly, “if it is used right, I think good
body maple goes a good ways toward makin’ a angel.”</p>

<p>As I say, I have had these angels in my room&mdash;some
kinder slimmish ones, some, that would go nigh on to
2 hundred by the stellyards, I don’t care if they went 3
hundred quick, I should call ’em angels jest the same.</p>

<p>Then there is them wimmen that go to have a good
time of it, they get kinder sick of stayin’ to home,
and nothin’ happenin’. And so they take thier work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and flock in to visit the afflicted. I should think I
had pretty near 25 a day of ’em, and each one started
25 different subjects. Wild, crazy subjects, most of
’em, such as fires, runaway matches, and whirlwinds;
earthquakes, neighberhood fightin’, and butter that
wouldn’t come; great tidal waves, railroad axidents,
balky horses, and overskirts; man slaughter, politix,
schism, and frizzled hair.</p>

<p>I believe it would have drawed more sweat from a
able bodied man to have laid still and heard it, than to
mow a five acre lot in dog days. And there my head
was takin’ on, and achin’ as if it would come off all
the time.</p>

<p>If I could have had one thing at a time, I could
have stood it better. I shouldn’t have minded a earthquake
so much, if I could have give my full attention
to it, but I must have conflegrations at the same time
on my mind, and hens that wouldn’t set, and drunken
men, and crazy wimmin, and jumpin’ sheep, and female
suffragin’ and calico cut biasin’, and the Rushen
war, and politix. It did seem some of the time, that
my head must split open, and I guess the doctor got
scairt about me, for one mornin’ after he went away,
Josiah came into the room, and I see that he looked
awful sober and gloomy, but the minute he ketched
my eye, he began to snicker and laugh. I didn’t say
nothin’ at first, and shet my eyes, but when I opened
’em agin, there he was a standin’ lookin’ down on me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
with the same mournful, agonized expression onto his
features; not a word did he speak, but when he see
me a lookin’ at him, he bust out laughin’ agin, and
then says I&mdash;</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Josiah Allen?”</p>

<p>Says he, “I’m a bein’ cheerful, Samantha!”</p>

<p class="caption">BEIN’ CHEERFUL.</p>
</div>

<p>Says I in the faint accents of weakness, “You are
bein’ a natural born idiot, and do you stop it.”</p>

<p>Says he, “I won’t stop it, Samantha, I <em>will</em> be cheerful;”
and he giggled.</p>

<p>Says I, “Won’t you go out, and let me rest a little,
Josiah Allen?”</p>

<p>“No!” says he firmly, “I will stand by you, and I
will be cheerful,” and he snickered the loudest he had
yet, but at the same time his countenance was so
awfully gloomy and anxious lookin’ that it filled me
with a strange awe as he continued&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“The doctor told me that you must be kep’ perfectly
quiet, and I must be cheerful before you, and while
I have the spirit of a man I <em>will</em> be cheerful,” and with
a despairin’ countenance, he giggled and snickered.</p>

<p>I knew what a case he was to do his duty, and I
groaned out, “There haint no use a tryin’ to stop
him.”</p>

<p>“No,” says he, “there haint no use a arguin’ with
me&mdash;I shall do my duty.” And he bust out into a
awful laugh that almost choked him.</p>

<p>I knew there wouldn’t be no rest for me, while he
stood there performin’ like a circus, and so says I in a
strategim way&mdash;</p>

<p>“It seems to me as if I should like a little lemonade,
Josiah, but the lemons are all gone.”</p>

<p>Says he, “I will harness up the old mare and start
for Jonesville this minute, and get you some.”</p>

<p>But after he got out in the kitchen, and his hat on,
he stuck his head into the door, and with a mournful
countenance, snickered.</p>

<p>After he fairly sot sail for Jonesville, now, thinks I
to myself, I will have a good nap, and rest my head
while he is gone, and I had jest got settled down, and
was thinkin’ sweetly how slow the old mare was, when
I heerd a noise in the kitchen. And Tirzah Ann come
in, and says she&mdash;</p>

<p>“Betsey Bobbet has come; I told her I guessed you
was a goin’ to sleep, and she hadn’t better come in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
but she acted so mad about it, that I don’t know what
to do.”</p>

<p>Before I could find time to tell her to lock the door,
and put a chair against it, Betsey come right in, and
says she&mdash;</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen’s wife, how do you feel this mornin’?”
and she added sweetly, “You see I have come.”</p>

<p>“I feel dreadful bad and feverish, this mornin’,”
says I, groanin’ in spite of myself. For my head felt
the worst it had, everything looked big, and sick to
the stomach to me, kinder waverin’ and floatin’ round
like.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know jest how you feel, Josiah Allen’s wife,
for I have felt jest so, only a great deal worse&mdash;why,
talkin’ about fevahs, Josiah Allen’s wife, I have had
such a fevah that the sweat stood in great drops all
ovah me.”</p>

<p>She took her things off, and laid ’em on the table,
and she had a bag hangin’ on her arm pretty near as
big as a flour sack, and she laid that down in one chair
and took another one herself, and then she continued,</p>

<p>“I have come down to spend the entiah day with
you, Josiah Allen’s wife. We heerd that you was
sick, and we thought we would all come doun and
spend the day with you. We have got relations from
a distance visitin’ us,&mdash;relations on fathah’s side&mdash;and
they are all a comin’. Mothah is comin’ and Aunt
Betsey, and cousin Annah Mariah and her two
children. But we don’t want you to make any fuss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
for us at all&mdash;only cousin Annah Mariah was sayin’
yesterday that she did want an old-fashioned boiled
dinnah, before she went back to New York. Mothah
was goin’ to boil one yesterday, but you know jest how
it scents up a house, and in <em>my</em> situation, not knowin’
<em>when</em> I shall receive interestin’ calls, I <em>do</em> want to keep
up a agreeable atmospheah. I told Annah Mariah <em>you</em>
had all kinds of garden sauce. We don’t want you
to make any difference for us&mdash;not in the least&mdash;but
boiled dinnahs, with a boiled puddin’ and sugar sauce,
are perfectly beautiful.”</p>

<p>I groaned in a low tone, but Betsey was so engaged
a talkin’, that she didn’t heed it, but went on in a high,
excited tone&mdash;</p>

<p>“I come on a little ahead, for I wanted to get a pattern
for a bedquilt, if you have got one to suit me. I
am goin’ to piece up a bedquilt out of small pieces of
calico I have been savin’ for yeahs. And I brought
the whole bag of calicoes along, for Mothah and cousin
Annah Mariah said they would assist me in piecin’ up
to-day, aftah I get them cut out. You know I may
want bedquilts suddenly. A great many young girls
are bein’ snatched away this spring. I think it becomes
us all to be prepared. Aunt Betsey would help
me too, but she is in a dreadful hurry with a rag carpet.
She is goin’ to bring down a basket full of red
and yellow rags that mothah gave her, to tear up to-day.
She said that it was not very pretty work to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
carry visatin’, but I told her you was sick and would
not mind it. I guess,” she continued, takin’ up her
bag, “I will pour these calicoes all out upon the table,
and then I will look at your bedquilts and patterns.”
And she poured out about half a bushel of crazy lookin’
pieces of calico on the table, no two pieces of a size
or color.</p>

<p class="caption">KEEPIN’ THE SICK QUIET.</p>
</div>

<p>I groaned loudly, in spite of myself, and shut my
eyes. She heard the groan, and see the agony on to
my eye brow, and says she,</p>

<p>“The doctor said to our house this morning, that
you must be kept perfectly quiet&mdash;and I tell you
Josiah Allen’s wife, that you <em>must not</em> get excited.
We talked it over this morning, we said we were all
going to put in together, that you should keep perfectly
quiet, and not get excited in your mind. And
now what would you advise me to do? Would you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
have a sunflower bedquilt, or a blazing stah? Take it
right to yourself Josiah Allen’s wife, what would you
do about it? But do not excite yourself any. Blazing
stahs look more showy, but then sun-flowehs are
easier to quilt. Quilt once around every piece, and it
is enough, and looks well on the other side, I am
going to line it with otteh coloh&mdash;white looks betteh,
but if two little children jest of an age, should happen
to be a playing on it, it would keep clean longeh.”</p>

<p>Agin I groaned, and says Betsey, “I do wish you
would take my advice Josiah Allen’s wife, and keep
perfectly quiet in your mind. I should think you
would,” says she reproachfully. “When I have told
you, how much betteh it would be for you. I guess,”
says she, “that you need chirking up a little. I must
enliven you, and make you look happier before I go
on with my bedquilt, and before we begin to look at
your patterns and bedquilts, I will read a little to you,
I calculated too, if you was low spirited; I came prepared.”
And takin’ a paper out of her pocket she
says,</p>

<p>“I will now proceed to read to you one of the longest,
most noble and eloquent editorials that has eveh
come out in the pages of the Augah, written by its
noble and eloquent Editah. It is six columns in
length, and is concerning our relations with Spain.”</p>

<p>This was too much&mdash;too much&mdash;and I sprung up on
my couch, and cried wildly,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let the Editor of the Augur and his relations go
to Spain! And do you go to Spain with your relations!”
says I, “and do you start this minute!”</p>

<p>Betsey was appalled, and turned to flee, and I cried
out agin,</p>

<p>“Do you take your bedquilt with you.”</p>

<p>She gathered up her calicoes, and fled. And I sunk
back, shed one or two briny tears of relief, and then
sunk into a sweet and refreshin’ sleep. And from that
hour I gained on it. But in the next week’s Augur,
these and 10 more verses like ’em come out.</p>

<h2 id="THE_JONESVILLE_SINGIN_QUIRE">THE JONESVILLE SINGIN’ QUIRE.</h2>

<p>Thomas Jefferson is a good boy. His teacher to the
Jonesville Academy told me the other day, says he,</p>

<p>“Thomas J. is full of fun, but I don’t believe he
has a single bad habit; and I don’t believe he knows
any more about bad things, than Tirzah Ann, and she
is a girl of a thousand.”</p>

<p>This made my heart beat with pure and fervent
emotions of joy, for I knew it was true, but I tell you
I have had to work for it. I was determined from the
first, that Thomas Jefferson needn’t think because he
was a boy he could do anything that would be considered
disgraceful if he was a girl. Now some mothers
will worry themselves to death about thier girls, so
afraid they will get into bad company and bring disgrace
onto ’em. I have said to ’em sometimes,</p>

<p>“Why don’t you worry about your boys?”</p>

<p>“Oh things are winked at in a man that haint in a
woman.”</p>

<p>Says I, “There is one woman that no man can get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to wink at ’em, and that is Samantha Allen, whose
maiden name was Smith.” Says I, “It is enough to
make anybody’s blood bile in thier vains to think how
different sin is looked upon in a man and woman. I
say sin is sin, and you can’t make goodness out of it
by parsin’ it in the masculine gender, no more’n you
can by parsin’ it in the feminine or neutral.</p>

<p>“And wimmin are the most to blame in this respect. I
believe in givin’ the D&mdash;&mdash;I won’t speak the gentleman’s
name right out, because I belong to the Methodist
Meetin’ house, but you know who I mean, and I
believe in givin’ him his due, if you owe him anything,
and I say men haint half so bad as wimmen
about holdin’ up male sinners and stompin’ down
female ones.</p>

<p>“Wimmen are meaner than pusley about some things,
and this is one of ’em. Now wimmen will go out and
kill the fatted calf with thier own hands to feast the
male prodigal that has been livin’ on husks. But let
the woman that he has been boardin’ with on the same
bundle of husks, ask meekly for a little mite of this
veal critter, will she get it? No! She won’t get so
much as one of the huffs. She will be told to keep
on eatin’ her husks, and after she has got through with
’em to die, for after a <em>woman</em> has once eat husks, she
can’t never eat any other vittles. And if she asks
meekly, why is her stomach so different from the
male husk eater, <em>he</em> went right off from husks to fatted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
calves, they’ll say to her ‘what is sin in a woman
haint sin in a man. Men are such noble creatures that
they <em>will</em> be a little wild, it is expected of ’em, but
after they have sowed all thier wild oats, they always
settle down and make the very best of men.’</p>

<p>“‘Can’t I settle down too?’ cries the poor woman.
‘<em>I</em> am sick of wild oats too, <em>I</em> am sick of husks&mdash;I
want to live a good life, in the sight of God and man&mdash;can’t
I settle down too?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes you can settle down in the grave,’ they say
to her&mdash;‘When a woman has sinned once, that is all
the place there is for her&mdash;a woman <em>cannot</em> be forgiven.’
There is an old sayin’ ‘Go and sin no more.’
But that is eighteen hundred years old&mdash;awful old
fashioned.”</p>

<p>And then after they have feasted the male husk
eater, on this gospel veal, and fell on his neck and
embraced him a few times, they will take him into
thier houses and marry him to their purest and prettiest
daughter, while at the same time they won’t have
the female husker in thier kitchen to wash for ’em at
4 cents an article.</p>

<p>I say it is a shame and a disgrace, for the woman to
bear all the burden of sufferin’ and all the burden of
shame too; it is a mean, cowardly piece of business,
and I should think the very stuns would go to yellin’
at each other to see such injustice.</p>

<p>But Josiah Allen’s children haint been brought up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
in any such kind of a way. They have been brought
up to think that sin of any kind is jest as bad in a man
as it is in a woman. And any place of amusement
that was bad for a woman to go to, was bad for a man.</p>

<p>Now when Thomas Jefferson was a little feller, he
was bewitched to go to circuses, and Josiah said,</p>

<p>“Better let him go, Samantha, it haint no place for
wimmin or girls, but it won’t hurt a boy.”</p>

<p>Says I, “Josiah Allen, the Lord made Thomas Jefferson
with jest as pure a heart as Tirzah Ann, and no
bigger eyes and ears, and if Thomas J. goes to the circus,
Tirzah Ann goes too.”</p>

<p>That stopped that. And then he was bewitched to
get with other boys that smoked and chewed tobacco,
and Josiah was jest that easy turn, that he would have
let him go with ’em. But says I&mdash;</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen, if Thomas Jefferson goes with those
boys, and gets to chewin’ and smokin’ tobacco, I shall
buy Tirzah Ann a pipe.”</p>

<p>And that stopped that.</p>

<p>“And about drinkin’,” says I. “Thomas Jefferson,
if it should ever be the will of Providence to change
you into a wild bear, I will chain you up, and do the
best I can by you. But if you ever do it yourself, turn
yourself into a wild beast by drinkin’, I will run away,
for I never could stand it, never. And,” I continued,
“if I ever see you hangin’ round bar-rooms and tavern
doors, Tirzah Ann shall hang too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Josiah argued with me, says he, “It don’t look so
bad for a boy as it does for a girl.”</p>

<p>Says I, “Custom makes the difference; we are more
used to seein’ men. But,” says I, “when liquor goes
to work to make a fool and a brute of anybody it don’t
stop to ask about sect, it makes a wild beast and a
idiot of a man or a woman, and to look down from
Heaven, I guess a man looks as bad layin’ dead drunk
in a gutter as a woman does,” says I; “things look
different from up there, than what they do to us&mdash;it is
a more sightly place. And you talk about <em>looks</em>, Josiah
Allen. I don’t go on clear looks, I go onto principle.
Will the Lord say to me in the last day, ‘Josiah
Allen’s wife, how is it with the sole of Tirzah
Ann&mdash;as for Thomas Jefferson’s sole, he bein’ a boy it
haint of no account?’ No! I shall have to give an
account to Him for my dealin’s with both of these
soles, male and female. And I should feel guilty if I
brought him up to think that what was impure for a
woman, was pure for a man. If man has a greater desire
to do wrong&mdash;which I won’t dispute,” says I lookin’
keenly on to Josiah, “he has greater strength to
resist temptation. And so,” says I in mild accents,
but firm as old Plymouth Rock, “if Thomas Jefferson
hangs, Tirzah Ann shall hang too.”</p>

<p>I have brought Thomas Jefferson up to think that
it was jest as bad for him to listen to a bad story or
song, as for a girl, or worse, for he had more strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to run away, and that it was a disgrace for him to talk
or listen to any stuff that he would be ashamed to have
Tirzah Ann or me hear. I have brought him up to
think that manliness didn’t consist in havin’ a cigar in
his mouth, and his hat on one side, and swearin’ and
slang phrases, and a knowledge of questionable amusements,
but in layin’ holt of every duty that come to
him, with a brave heart and a cheerful face; in helpin’
to right the wrong, and protect the weak, and makin’
the most and the best of the mind and the soul God
had given him. In short, I have brought him up to
think that purity and virtue are both masculine and
femanine gender, and that God’s angels are not necessarily
all she ones.</p>

<p>Tirzah Ann too has come up well, though I say it,
that shouldn’t, her head haint all full, runnin’ over,
and frizzlin’ out on top of it, with thoughts of beaux
and flirtin’. I have brought her up to think that marriage
wasn’t the chief end of life, but savin’ her soul.
Tirzah Ann’s own grandmother on her mother’s side,
used to come visatin’ us and stay weeks at a time,
kinder spyin’ out I spose how I done by the children,&mdash;thank
fortune, I wasn’t afraid to have her spy, all
she was a mind too, I wouldn’t have been afraid to
had Benedict Arnold, and Major Andre come as spys.
I did well by ’em, and she owned it, though she did
think I made Tirzah Ann’s night gowns a little too
full round the neck, and Thomas Jefferson’s roundabouts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
a little too long behind. But as I was a sayin’,
the old lady begun to kinder train Tirzah Ann up to
the prevailin’ idee of its bein’ her only aim in life to
catch a husband, and if she would only grow up and
be a real good girl she should marry.</p>

<p>I didn’t say nothin’ to the old lady, for I respect old
age, but I took Josiah out one side, and says I,</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen, if Tirzah Ann is to be brought up
to think that marriage is the chief aim of her life,
Thomas J. shall be brought up to think that marriage
is his chief aim.” Says I, “it looks just as flat in a
woman, as it does in a man.”</p>

<p>Josiah didn’t make much of any answer to me, he
is an easy man. But as that was the old lady’s last
visit (she was took bed rid the next week, and haint
walked a step sense), I haint had no more trouble on
them grounds.</p>

<p>When Tirzah Ann gets old enough, if a good true
man, a man for instance, such as I think Whitfield
Minkley, our minister’s oldest boy is a goin’ to make,
if such a man offers Tirzah Ann his love which is the
greatest honor a man can do a woman, why Tirzah
will, I presume, if she loves him well enough, marry
him. I should give my consent, and so would Josiah.
But to have all her mind sot onto that hope and
expectatin’ till she begins to look wild, I have discouraged
it in her.</p>

<p>I have told her that goodness, truth, honor, vertue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and nobility come first as aims in life. Says I,</p>

<p>“Tirzah Ann, seek these things first, and then if a
husband is added unto you, you may know it is the
Lord’s will, and accept him like any other dispensation
of Providence, and&mdash;” I continued as dreamy thoughts
of Josiah floated through my mind, “make the best of
him.”</p>

<p>I feel thankful to think they have both come up as
well as they have. Tirzah Ann is more of a quiet
turn, but Thomas J., though his morals are sound, is
dreadful full of fun, I worry some about him for he
haint made no professions, I never could get him
forred onto the anxious seat. He told Elder Minkley
last winter that “the seats were all made of the same
kind of basswood, and he could be jest as anxious out
by the door, as he could on one of the front seats.”</p>

<p>Says Elder Minkley, “My dear boy, I want you to
find the Lord.”</p>

<p>“I haint never lost him,” says Thomas Jefferson.</p>

<p>It shocked Elder Minkley dreadfully&mdash;but it sot me
to thinkin’. He was always an odd child, always askin’
the curiousest questions, and I brought him up to
think that the Lord was with him all the time, and
see what he was doin’, and mebby he was in the right
of it, mebby he felt as if he hadn’t never lost Him.
He was always the greatest case to be out in the woods
and lots, findin’ everything&mdash;and sometimes I have
almost thought the trash he thinks so much of, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
as shells and pieces of rock and stun, and flowers and
moss, are a kind of means of grace to him, and then
agin I don’t know. If I really thought they was I
don’t suppose I should have pitched ’em out of the
winder so many times as I have, clutterin’ up the
house so.</p>

<p>I worry about him awfully sometimes, and then agin
I lay holt of the promises. Now last Saturday night
to have heard him go on, about the Jonesville quire,
you’d a thought he never had a sober, solemn thought
in his head. They meet to practice Saturday nights,
and he had been to hear ’em. I stood his light talk
as long as I could, and finally I told him to stop it,
for I would not hear him go on so.</p>

<p>“Wall,” says he, “you go yourself mother sometime,
and see thier carryin’s on. Why,” says he, “if
fightin’ entitles anybody to a pension, they ought to
draw 96 dollars a year, every one of ’em&mdash;you go
yourself, and hear ’em rehearse if you don’t believe
me&mdash;” and then he begun to sing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Just before the battle, mother,</div>
<div class="verse i3">I am thinkin’ now of you.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I’ll be hanged if I would rehearse,” says Josiah,
“what makes ’em?”</p>

<p>“Let ’em rehearse,” says I sternly, “I should think
there was need enough of it.”</p>

<p>It happened that very next night, Elder Merton
preached to the red school house, and Josiah hitched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
up the old mare, and we went over. It was the first
time I had been out sense the axident. Thomas J.
and Tirzah Ann walked.</p>

<p>Josiah and I sot right behind the quire, and we
could hear every word they said, and while Elder Merton
was readin’ the hymn, “How sweet for brethren
to agree,” old Gowdey whispered to Mr. Peedick in
wrathful accents,</p>

<p>“I wonder if you will put us all to open shame
to-night by screechin’ two or three notes above us
all?”</p>

<p>He caught my keen grey eye fixed sternly upon
him, and his tone changed in a minute to a mild,
sheepish one, and he added smilin’ “as it were, deah
brother Peedick.”</p>

<p>Mr. Peedick designed not to reply to him, for he
was shakin’ his fist at one of the younger brethrin’ in
the quire, and says he,</p>

<p>“Let me catch you pressin’ the key agin to-night,
you young villain, if you think it is best.”</p>

<p>“I shall press as many keys as I am a minter for
all you. You’re always findin’ fault with sunthin’ or
other,” muttered he.</p>

<p>Betsey Bobbet and Sophronia Gowdey was lookin’
at each other all this time with looks that made one’s
blood run cold in thier vains.</p>

<p>Mr. Peedick commenced the tune, but unfortunately
struck into short metre. They all commenced loud
and strong, but couldn’t get any further than “How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
sweet for bretherin.” As they all come to a sudden
halt there in front of that word&mdash;Mr. Gowdey&mdash;lookin’
daggers at Mr. Peedick&mdash;took out his pitch fork, as if it
was a pistol, and he was goin’ to shoot him with it,
but applyin’ it to his own ear, he started off on the
longest metre that had ever been in our neighborhood.
After addin’ the tune to the words, there was
so much tune to carry, that the best calculator in tunes
couldn’t do it.</p>

<p>At that very minute when it looked dark, and
gloomy indeed for the quire, an old lady, the best
behaved in the quire, who had minded her own business,
and chawed caraway peacefully, come out and
started it to the tune of “Oh that will be joyful.”</p>

<p>They all joined in at the top of their voice, and
though they each one put in flats and sharps to suit
thier own taste, they kinder hung together till they
got to the chorus, and then Mr. Gowdey looked round
and frowned fiercely at Shakespeare Bobbet who
seemed to be flattin’ most of any of ’em, and Betsey
Bobbet punched Sophronia Gowdey in the side with
her parasol, and told her she was “disgracin’ the
quire&mdash;and to sing slower,” and then they all yelled</p>

<p>It seemed as if the very feather on my bunnet stood
up straight, to hear ’em, it was so awful. Then they
collected their strength, and drawin’ long breaths, they
yelled out the next verses like wild Indians round

<p>Elder Merton made a awful good prayer, about trials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
purifyin’ folks and makin’ ’em better, and the same
heroic patient look was on his face, when he give out
the next him.</p>

<p>This piece begun with a long duett between the
tenor and the alto, and Betsey Bobbet by open war
and strategim had carried the day, and was to sing this
part alone with the tenor. She knew the Editer of
the Augur was the only tenor singer in the quire.
She was so proud and happy thinkin’ she was goin’ to
sing alone with him, that not rightly sensin’ where
she was, and what she was about, she pitched her part
too low, and here was where I had my trial with
Josiah.</p>

<p>There is no more sing to Josiah Allen than there is
to a one horse wagon, and I have tried to convince
him of it, but I can’t, and he will probably go down
to the grave thinkin’ he can sing base. But thier is
no sing to it, that, I will contend for with my last
breath, it is nothin’ more nor less than a roar. But
one thing I will give him the praise of, he is a dreadful
willin’ man in the time of trouble, and if he takes
it into his head that it is his duty to sing, you can’t
stop him no more than you can stop a clap of thunder,
and when he does let his voice out, he lets it out
strong, I can tell you. As Betsey finished the first
line, I heard him say to himself.</p>

<p>“It is a shame for one woman to sing base alone, in
a room full of men.” And before I could stop him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
he struck in with his awful energy, you couldn’t hear
Betsey’s voice, nor the Editer’s, no more than you
could hear two flies buzzin’ in a car whistle. It was
dreadful. And as he finished the first verse, I ketched
hold of his vest, I didn’t stand up, by reason of bein’
lame yet from the axident&mdash;and says I,</p>

<p>“If you sing another verse in that way, I’ll part
with you,” says I, “what do you mean Josiah Allen?”</p>

<p>Says he, lookin’ doun on me with the persperation a
pourin’ down his face,</p>

<p>“I am a singin’ base.”</p>

<p>Says I, “Do you set down and behave yourself,
she has pitched it too low, it hain’t base, Josiah.”</p>

<p>Says he, “I know better Samantha, it <em>is</em> base, I
guess I know base when I hear it.”</p>

<p>But I still held him by the vest, determined that he
shouldn’t start off again, if I could hender it, and jest
at that minute the duett begun agin, and Sophronia
Gowdey took advantage of Betsey’s indignation and
suprise, and took the part right out of her mouth, and
struck in with the Editer of the Augur&mdash;she is kinder
after him too, and she broke out with the curiousest
variations you ever heard. The warblin’s and quaverin’s
and shakin’s, she put in was the curiousest of any
thing I ever heard. And thankful was I that it took
up Josiah’s attention so, that he sunk down on his
seat, and listened to ’em with breathless awe, and never
offered to put in his note at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>I waited till they got through singin’ and then I
whispered to him, and says I,</p>

<p>“Now do you keep still for the rest of this meetin’
Josiah Allen.”</p>

<p>Says he, “As long as I call myself a man, I will
have the privilege of singin’ base.”</p>

<p>“<em>Sing</em>,” says I in a tone almost cold enough to
make his whiskers frosty, “I’d call it <em>singin’</em> if I was
you.” It worried me all through meetin’ time, and
thankful was I when he dropped off into a sweet sleep
jest before meetin’ was out. He never heard ’em sing
the last time, and I had to hunch him for the
benediction.</p>

<p>In the next week’s Augur came out a lot of verses,
among which were the following: they were headed</p>

<p>There was 13 verses and Josiah read them all, but I
wouldn’t read but 7 of ’em. I don’t like poetry.</p>

<h2 id="MISS_SHAKESPEARES_EARRINGS">MISS SHAKESPEARE’S EARRINGS.</h2>

<p>Them verses of Betsey’s kinder worked Josiah up,
I know, though he didn’t say much. That line “dreadful
roars of awful base” mortified him, I know, because
he actually did think that he sung pretty enough
for a orkusstry. I didn’t say much to him about it.
I don’t believe in twittin’ all the time, about anything,
for it makes anybody feel as unpleasant as it does to
set down on a paper of carpet tacks. I only said to
him&mdash;</p>

<p>“I tried to convince you, Josiah, that you <em>couldn’t</em>
sing, for 14 years, and now that it has come out in poetry
mebby you’ll believe it. I guess you’ll listen to
me another time, Josiah Allen.”</p>

<p>He says, “I wish you wouldn’t be so aggravatin’,
Samantha.”</p>

<p>That was all that was said on either side. But I
noticed that he didn’t sing any more. We went to
several conference meetin’s that week, and not one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
roar did he give. It was an awful relief to me, for I
never felt safe for a minute, not knowin’ when he
would break out.</p>

<p>The next week Saturday after the poetry come
out, Tirzah took it into her head that she wanted to
go to Elder Morton’s a visitin’; Maggie Snow was a
goin’ to meet her there, and I told her to go&mdash;I’d get
along with the work somehow.</p>

<p>I had to work pretty hard, but then I got it all out
of the way early, and my head combed and my dress
changed, and I was jest pinnin’ my linen coller over
my clean gingham dress (broun and black plaid) to the
lookin’ glass, when lookin’ up, who should I see but
Betsey Bobbet comin’ through the gate. She stopped
a minute to Tirzah Ann’s posy bed, and then she come
along kinder gradually, and stopped and looked at my
new tufted bedspread that I have got out a whitenin’
on the grass, and then she come up the steps and
come in.</p>

<p>Somehow I was kinder glad to see her that day. I
had had first rate luck with all my bakin’, every
thing had turned out well, and I felt real reconciled
to havin’ a visit from her.</p>

<p>But I see she looket ruther gloomy, and after she
sot down and took out her tattin’ and begun to tat, she
spoke up and says she&mdash;</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen’s wife, I feel awful deprested to-day.”</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” says I in a cheerful tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“I feel lonely,” says she, “more lonely than I have
felt for yeahs.”</p>

<p>Again says I kindly but firmly&mdash;</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Betsey?”</p>

<p>“I had a dream last night, Josiah Allen’s wife.”</p>

<p>“What was it?” says I in a sympathizin’ accent, for
she did look meloncholly and sad indeed.</p>

<p>“I dreamed I was married, Josiah Allen’s wife,”
says she in a heart-broken tone, and she laid her hand
on my arm in her deep emotion. “I tell you it was
hard after dreamin’ that, to wake up again to the cold
realities and cares of this life; it was <em>hard</em>,” she repeated,
and a tear gently flowed down her Roman nose
and dropped off onto her overskirt. She knew salt
water would spot otter color awfully, and so she drew
her handkerchief out of her pocket, and spread it in
her lap, (it was white trimmed with narrow edgein’)
and continued&mdash;</p>

<p>“Life seemed so hard and lonesome to me, that I
sot up in the end of the bed and wept. I tried to get
to sleep again, hopin’ I would dream it ovah, but I
could not.”</p>

<p>And again two salt tears fell in about the middle of
the handkerchief. I see she needed consolation, and
my gratitude made me feel soft to her, and so says I
in a reasurin’ tone&mdash;</p>

<p>“To be sure husbands are handy on 4th of July’s,
and funeral prosessions, it looks kinder lonesome to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
see a woman streamin’ along alone, but they are contrary
creeters, Betsey, when they are a mind to be.”</p>

<p>And then to turn the conversation and get her mind
off’en her trouble, says I,</p>

<p>“How did you like my bed spread, Betsey?”</p>

<p>“It is beautiful,” says she sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Yes,” says I, “it looks well enough now its done,
but it most wore my fingers out a tuftin’ it&mdash;it’s a
sight of work.”</p>

<p>But I saw how hard it was to draw her mind off
from broodin’ over her troubles, for she spoke in a
mournful tone,</p>

<p>“How sweet it must be to weah the fingers out for
a deah companion. I would be willing to weah mine
clear down to the bone. I made a vow some yeahs
ago,” says she, kinder chirkin’ up a little, and beginnin’
to tat agin. “I made a vow yeahs ago that
I would make my deah future companion happy, for I
would neveh, neveh fail to meet him with a sweet
smile as he came home to me at twilight. I felt that
that was all he would requireh to make him happy.
Do you think it was a rash vow, Josiah Allen’s wife?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” says I in a sort of blind way, “I guess it
won’t do any hurt. But, if a man couldn’t have
but one of the two, a smile or a supper, as he come
home at night, I believe he would take the supper.”</p>

<p>“Oh deah,” says Betsey, “such cold, practical ideahs
are painful to me.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” says I cheerfully but firmly, “if you ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
have the opportunity, you try both ways. You jest
let your fire go out, and your house and you look like
fury, and nothin’ to eat, and you stand on the door
smilin’ like a first class idiot&mdash;and then agin you have
a first rate supper on the table, stewed oysters, and
warm biscuit and honey, or somethin’ else first rate,
and a bright fire shinin’ on a clean hearth, and the tea-kettle
a singin’, and the tea-table all set out neat as a
pink, and you goin’ round in a cheerful, sensible way
gettin’ the supper onto the table, and you jest watch,
and see which of the two ways is the most agreable
to him.”</p>

<p>Betsey still looked unconvinced, and I proceeded
onwards.</p>

<p>“Now I never was any hand to stand and smile at
Josiah for two or three hours on a stretch, it would
make me feel like a natural born idiot; but I always
have a bright fire, and a warm supper a waitin’ for
him when he comes home at night.”</p>

<p>“Oh food! food! what is food to the deathless emotions
of the soul. What does the aching young heart
care for what food it eats&mdash;let my deah future companion
smile on me, and that is enough.”</p>

<p>Says I in reasonable tones, “A man <em>can’t</em> smile on
an empty stomach Betsey, not for any length of time.
And no man can’t eat soggy bread, with little chunks
of salaratus in it, and clammy potatoes, and beefsteak
burnt and raw in spots, and drink dishwatery tea, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
muddy coffee, and smile&mdash;or they might give one or
2 sickly, deathly smiles, but they wouldn’t keep it up,
you depend upon it they wouldn’t, and it haint in the
natur’ of a man to, and I say they hadn’t ought to.
I have seen bread Betsey Bobbet, that was enough to
break down any man’s affection for a woman, unless
he had firm principle to back it up&mdash;and love’s young
dream has been drounded in thick, muddy coffee
more’n once. If there haint anything pleasant in a
man’s home how can he keep attached to it? Nobody,
man nor woman can’t respect what haint respectable,
or love what haint lovable. I believe in bein’ cheerful
Betsey; a complainin’, fretful woman in the house,
is worse than a cold, drizzlin’ rain comin’ right down
all the time onto the cook stove. Of course men have
to be corrected, I correct Josiah frequently, but I
believe in doin’ it all up at one time and then have it
over with, jest like a smart dash of a thunder shower
that clears up the air.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how a female woman that is blest with a deah
companion, can even speak of correcting him, is a mystery
to me.”</p>

<p>But again I spoke, and my tone was as firm and
lofty as Bunker Hill monument&mdash;</p>

<p>“Men <em>have</em> to be corrected, Betsey, there wouldn’t
be no livin’ with ’em unless you did.”</p>

<p>“Well,” says she, “you can entertain such views as
you will, but for me, I <em>will</em> be clingin’ in my nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
I <em>will</em> be respected by men, they do so love to have
wimmin clingin’, that I will, until I die, carry out this
belief that is so sweet to them&mdash;until I die I will nevah
let go of this speah.”</p>

<p>I didn’t say nothin’, for gratitude tied up my tongue,
but as I rose and went up stairs to wind me a little
more yarn&mdash;I thought I wouldn’t bring down the swifts
for so little as I wanted to wind&mdash;I thought sadly to
myself, what a hard, hard time she had had, sense I
had known her, a handlin’ that spear. We got to
talkin’ about it the other day, how long she had been
a handlin’ of it. Says Thomas Jefferson, “She has
been brandishin’ it for fifty years.”</p>

<p>Says I, “Shet up, Thomas J., she haint been born
longer ago than that.”</p>

<p>Says he&mdash;“She was born with that spear in her
hand.”</p>

<p>But as I said she has had a hard and mournful time
a tryin’ to make a runnin’ vine of herself sense I knew
her. And Josiah says she was at it, for years before
I ever see her. She has tried to make a vine of herself
to all kinds of trees, straight and crooked, sound
and rotten, young and old. Her mind is sot the most
now, on the Editer of the Augur, but she pays attention
to any and every single man that comes in her
way. And it seems strange to me that them that
preach up this doctrine of woman’s only spear, don’t
admire one who carrys it out to its full extent. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
seems kinder ungrateful in ’em, to think that when
Betsey is so willin’ to be a vine, they will not be a
tree; but they won’t, they seem sot against it.</p>

<p>I say if men insist on makin’ runnin’ vines of wimmin,
they ought to provide trees for ’em to run up on,
it haint nothin’ more’n justice that they should, but
they won’t and don’t. Now ten years ago the Methodist
minister before Elder Wesley Minkley came, was a
widower of some twenty odd years, and he was sorely
stricken with years and rheumatiz. But Betsey showed
plainly her willin’ness and desire to be a vine, if he
would be a tree. But he would not be a tree&mdash;he
acted real obstinate about it, considerin’ his belief.
For he was awful opposed to wimmin’s havin’ any
rights only the right to marry. He preached a beautiful
sermon about woman’s holy mission, and how
awful it was in her, to have any ambition outside of
her own home. And how sweet it was to see her in
her confidin’ weakness and gentleness clingin’ to man’s
manly strength. There wasn’t a dry eye in the house
only mine. Betsey wept aloud, she was so affected
by it. And it was beautiful, I don’t deny it; I always
respected clingers. But I love to see folks use reason.
And I say again, how can a woman cling when she
haint got nothin’ to cling to? That day I put it fair
and square to our old minister, he went home with us
to supper, and he begun on me about wimmin’s rights,
for he knew I believe in wimmin’s havin a right. Says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
he, “It is flyin’ in the face of the Bible for a woman
not to marry.”</p>

<p>Says I, “Elder how can any lady make brick without
straw or sand&mdash;<em>how</em> can a woman marry without
a man is forthcomin’?” says I, “wimmen’s will may be
good, but there is some things she can not do, and this
is one of ’em.” Says I, “as our laws are at present no
women can marry unless she has a man to marry to.
And if the man is obstinate and hangs back what is
she to do?”</p>

<p>He begun to look a little sheepish and tried to kinder
turn off the subject on to religion.</p>

<p>But no steamboat ever sailed onward under the power
of biled water steam, more grandly than did Samantha
Allen’s words under the steam of bilein’ principle.
I fixed my eyes upon him with seemin’ly an
arrow in each one of ’em, and says I&mdash;</p>

<p>“Which had you rather do Elder, let Betsey Bobbet
vote, or cling to you? She is fairly achin’ to make
a runnin’ vine of herself,” and says I, in slow, deep,
awful tones, “are you willin’ to be a tree?”</p>

<p>Again he weakly murmured somethin’ on the subject
of religion, but I asked him again in slower, awfuler
tones.</p>

<p>“<em>Are you willin’ to be a tree?</em>”</p>

<p>He turned to Josiah, and says he, “I guess I will
go out to the barn and bring in my saddle bags.” He
had come to stay all night. And that man went to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
barn smit and conscience struck, and haint opened his
head to me sense about wimmin’s not havin’ a right.</p>

<p>I had jest arrived at this crysis in my thoughts, and
had also got my yarn wound up&mdash;my yarn and my
revery endin’ up at jest the same time, when Betsey
came to the foot of the stairs and called out&mdash;</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen’s wife, a gentleman is below, and
craves an audience with you.”</p>

<p>I sot back my swifts, and went down, expectin’ from
the reverential tone of her voice to see a United States
Governor, or a Deacon at the very least. But it wasn’t
either of ’em, it was a peddler. He wanted to know
if I could get some dinner for him, and I thinkin’ one
more trial wouldn’t kill me said I would. He was a
loose jinted sort of a chap, with his hat sot onto one
side of his head, but his eyes had a twinkle to ’em,
that give the idee that he knew what he was about.</p>

<p>After dinner he kep’ a bringin’ on his goods from
his cart, and praisin’ ’em up, the lies that man told
was enough to apaul the ablest bodied man, but Betsey
swallowed every word. After I had coldly rejected
all his other overtures for tradin’, he brought on a
strip of stair carpetin’, a thin striped yarn carpet, and
says he&mdash;</p>

<p>“Can’t I sell you this beautiful carpet? it is the
pure Ingrain.”</p>

<p>“Ingrain,” says I, “so be you Ingrain as much.”</p>

<p>“I guess I know,” says he, “for I bought it of old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Ingrain himself, I give the old man 12 shillin’s a yard
for it, but seein’ it is you, and I like your looks so
much, and it seems so much like home to me here, I
will let you have it for 75 cents, cheaper than dirt to
walk on, or boards.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want it,” says I, “I have got carpets
enough.”</p>

<p>“Do you want it for 50 cents?” says he follerin’ me
to the wood-box.</p>

<p>“No!” says I pretty sharp, for I don’t want to say
no two times, to anybody.</p>

<p>“Would 25 cents be any indoosement to you?” says
he, follerin’ me to the buttery door.</p>

<p>“No!” says I in my most energetic voice, and started
for the suller with a plate of nut-cakes.</p>

<p>“Would 18 pence tempt you?” says he, hollerin’
down the suller way.</p>

<p>Then says I, comin’ up out of the suller with the
old Smith blood bilin’ up in my veins, “Say another
word to me about your old stair carpet if you dare;
jest let me ketch you at it,” says I; “be I goin’ to
have you traipse all over the house after me? be I goin’
to be made crazy as a loon by you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Josiah Allen’s wife,” says Betsey, “do not
be so hasty; of course the gentleman wishes to dispose
of his goods, else why should he be in the mercanteel
business?”</p>

<p>I didn’t say nothin’&mdash;gratitude still had holt of me&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
I inwardly determined that not one word would
I say if he cheated her out of her eye teeth.</p>

<p>Addressin’ his attention to Betsey, he took a pair
of old fashioned ear rings out of his jacket pocket, and
says he&mdash;</p>

<p>“I carry these in my pocket for fear I will be robbed
of ’em. I hadn’t ought to carry ’em at all, a single
man goin’ alone round the country as I do, but I have
got a pistol, and let anybody tackle me for these ear
rings if they dare to,” says he, lookin’ savage.</p>

<p>“Is thier intrinsick worth so large?” says Betsey,</p>

<p>“It haint so much thier neat value,” says he, “although
that is enormous, as who owned ’em informally.
Whose ears do you suppose these have had hold of?”</p>

<p>“How can I judge,” says Betsey with a winnin’
smile, “nevah havin’ seen them before.”</p>

<p>“Jest so,” says he, “you never was acquainted with
’em, but these very identical creeters used to belong
to Miss Shakespeare. Yes, these belonged to Hamlet’s
mother,” says he, lookin’ pensively upon them.
“Bill bought ’em at old Stratford.”</p>

<p>“Bill?” says Betsey inquirin’ly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” says he, “old Shakespeare. I have been
reared with his folks so much, that I have got into the
habit of callin’ him Bill, jest as they do.”</p>

<p>“Then you have been there?” says Betsey with a
admirin’ look.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, wintered there and partly summered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
But as I was sayin’ William bought ’em and give ’em
to his wife, when he first begun to pay attention to
her. Bill bought ’em at a auction of a one-eyed man
with a wooden leg, by the name of Brown. Miss
Shakespeare wore ’em as long as she lived, and they
was kept in the family till I bought ’em. A sister of
one of his brother-in-laws was obleeged to part with
’em to get morpheen.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you ask a large price for them?” says
Betsey, examanin’ ’em with a reverential look onto
her countenance.</p>

<p>“How much! how much you remind me of a favorite
sister of mine, who died when she was fifteen. She
was considered by good judges to be the handsomest
girl in North America. But business before pleasure.
I ought to have upwards of 30 dollars a head for ’em,
but seein’ it is you, and it haint no ways likely I shall
ever meet with another wo&mdash;young girl that I feel
under bonds to sell ’em to, you may have ’em for 13
dollars and a ½.”</p>

<p>“That is more money than I thought of expendin’
to-day,” says Betsey in a thoughtful tone.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you what I will do; I don’t care seein’
it is you, if I do get cheated, I am willin’ to be cheated
by one that looks so much like that angel sister. Give
me 13 dollars and a ½, and I will throw in the pin that
goes with ’em. I did want to keep that to remind me
of them happy days at old Stratford,” and he took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
breastpin out of his pocket, and put it in her hand in
a quick kind of a way. “Take ’em,” says he, turnin’
his eyes away, “take ’em and put ’em out of my sight,
quick! or I shall repent.”</p>

<p>“I do not want to rob you of them,” says Betsey
tenderly.</p>

<p>“Take ’em,” says he in a wild kind of a way, “take
’em, and give me the money quick, before I am completely
unmanned.”</p>

<p>She handed him the money, and says he in agitated
tones, “Take care of the ear rings, and heaven bless
you.” And he ketched up his things, and started off
in a awful hurry. Betsey gazed pensively out of the
winder, till he disapeared in the distance, and then she
begun to brag about her ear rings, as Miss Shakespeare’s
relicks. Thomas Jefferson praised ’em awfully
to Betsey’s face, when he came home, but when I was
in the buttery cuttin’ cake for supper, he come and
leaned over me and whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>That is jest the way he kep’ at it, he would kinder
happen round where I was, and every chance he would
get he would have over a string of them verses, till it
did seem as if I should go crazy. Finally I said to
him in tones before which he quailed,</p>

<p>“If I hear one word more of poetry from you to-night
I will complain to your father,” says I wildly,
“I don’t believe there is another woman in the United
States that suffers so much from poetry as I do! What
have I done,” says I still more wildly, “that I should
be so tormented by it?” says I, “I won’t hear another
word of poetry to-night,” says I, “I will stand for my
rights&mdash;I will not be drove into insanity with poetry.”</p>

<p>Betsey started for home in good season, and I told
her I would go as fur as Squire Edwards’es with her.
Miss Edwards was out by the gate, and of course Betsey
had to stop and show the ear rings. She was jest
lookin’ at ’em when the minister and Maggie Snow
and Tirzah Ann drove up to the gate, and wanted to
know what we was lookin’ at so close, and Betsey,
castin’ a proud and haughty look onto the girls, told
him that&mdash;</p>

<p>“It was a paih of ear rings that had belonged to
the immortal Mr. Shakespeah’s wife informally.”</p>

<p>The minute Elder Merton set his eyes on ’em,
“Why,” says he, “my wife sold these to a peddler
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says Tirzah Ann, “these are the very ones;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
she sold them for a dozen shirt buttons and a paper of
pins.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe it,” says Betsey wildly.</p>

<p>“It is so,” said the minister. “My wife’s father
got them for her, they proved to be brass, and so she
never wore them; to-day the peddler wanted to buy
old jewelry, and she brought out some broken rings,
and these were in the box, and she told him he might
have them in welcome, but he threw out the buttons
and a paper of pins.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe it&mdash;I cannot believe it,” says Betsey
gaspin’ for breath.</p>

<p>“Well, it is the truth,” says Maggie Snow (she can’t
bear Betsey), “and I heard him say he would get ’em
off onto some fool, and make her think&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am in such a hurry I must go,” said Betsey, and
she left without sayin’ another word.</p>

<h2 id="A_NIGHT_OF_TROUBLES">A NIGHT OF TROUBLES.</h2>

<p>Truly last night was a night of troubles to us. We
was kept awake all the forepart of the night with
cats fightin’. It does beat all how they went on, how
many there was of ’em I don’t know; Josiah thought
there was upwards of 50. I myself made a calm estimate
of between 3 and 4. But I tell you they went
in strong what there was of ’em. What under heavens
they found to talk about so long, and in such unearthly
voices, is a mystery to me. You couldn’t sleep
no more than if you was in Pandemonium. And
about 11, I guess it was, I heard Thomas Jefferson
holler out of his chamber winder, (it was Friday night
and the children was both to home,) says he&mdash;</p>

<p>“You have preached long enough brothers on that
text, I’ll put in a seventhly for you.” And then I
heard a brick fall. “You’ve protracted your meetin’
here plenty long enough. You may adjourn now to
somebody else’s window and exhort them a spell.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
And then I heard another brick fall. “Now I wonder
if you’ll come round on this circuit right away.”</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson’s room is right over ourn, and I
raised up in the end of the bed and hollered to him
to “stop his noise.” But Josiah said, “do let him be,
do let him kill the old creeters, I am wore out.”</p>

<p>Says I “Josiah I don’t mind his killin’ the cats, but
I won’t have him talkin about thier holdin’ a protracted
meetin’ and preachin’, I won’t have it,” says I.</p>

<p>“Wall,” says he “do lay down, the most I care for
is to get rid of the cats.”</p>

<p>Says I, “you do have wicked streaks Josiah, and
the way you let that boy go on is awful,” says I,
“where do you think you will go to Josiah Allen?”</p>

<p>Says he, “I shall go into another bed if you can’t
stop talkin’. I have been kept awake till midnight
by them creeters, and now you want to finish the
night.”</p>

<p>Josiah is a real even tempered man, but nothin’
makes him so kinder fretful as to be kept awake by
cats. And it is awful, awfully mysterious too. For
sometimes as you listen, you say mildly to yourself,
how can a animal so small give utterance to a noise so
large, large enough for a eliphant? Then sometimes
agin as you listen, you will get encouraged, thinkin’
that last yawl has really finished ’em and you think
they are at rest, and better off than they can be here
in this world, utterin’ such deathly and terrific shrieks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and you know <em>you</em> are happier. So you will be real
encouraged, and begin to be sleepy, when they break
out agin all of a sudden, seemin’ to say up in a small
fine voice, “We won’t go home till mornin’” drawin’
out the “mornin’” in the most threatenin’ and insultin’
manner. And then a great hoarse grum voice will
take it up “<em>We won’t Go Home till Mornin’</em>” and
then they will spit fiercely, and shriek out the appaulin’
words both together. It is discouragin’, and I
couldn’t deny it, so I lay down, and we both went to
sleep.</p>

<p>I hadn’t more’n got into a nap, when Josiah waked
me up groanin’, and says he, “them darned cats are at
it agin.”</p>

<p>“Well,” says I coolly, “you needn’t swear so, if
they be.” I listened a minute, and says I, “it haint
cats.”</p>

<p>Says he, “it is.”</p>

<p>Says I, “Josiah Allen, I know better, it haint cats.”</p>

<p>“Wall what is it,” says he “if it haint?”</p>

<p>I sot up in the end of bed, and pushed back my
night cap from my left ear and listened, and says I,</p>

<p>“It is a akordeun.”</p>

<p>“How come a akordeun under our winder?” says
he.</p>

<p>Says I, “It is Shakespeare Bobbet seranadin’ Tirzah
Ann, and he has got under the wrong winder.”</p>

<p>He leaped out of bed, and started for the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Says I, “Josiah Allen come back here this minute,”
says I, “do you realize your condition? you haint
dressed.”</p>

<p>He siezed his hat from the bureau, and put it on his
head, and went on. Says I, “Josiah Allen if you go
to the door in that condition, I’ll prosicute you; what
do you mean actin’ so to-night?” says I, “you was
young once yourself.”</p>

<p>“I wuzzn’t a confounded fool if I was young,” says
he.</p>

<p>Says I, “come back to bed Josiah Allen, do you
want to get the Bobbets’es and the Dobbs’es mad at
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes I <em>do</em>,” he snapped out.</p>

<p>“I should think you would be ashamed Josiah
swearin’ and actin’ as you have to-night,” and says I,
“you will get your death cold standin’ there without
any clothes on, come back to bed this minute Josiah
Allen.”</p>

<p>It haint often I set up, but when I do, I will be
minded; so finally he took off his hat and come to
bed, and there we had to lay and listen. Not one word
could Tirzah Ann hear, for her room was clear to the
other end of the house, and such a time as I had to
keep Josiah in the bed. The first he played was what
they call an involuntary, and I confess it did sound
like a cat, before they get to spittin’, and tearin’ out fur,
you know they will go on kinder meloncholy. He
went on in that way for a length of time which I can’t
set down with any kind of accuracy, Josiah thinks it
was about 2 hours and a half, I myself don’t believe it
was more than a quarter of an hour. Finally he broke
out singin’ a tune the chorus of which was,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Oh think of me&mdash;oh think of me.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“No danger of our not thinkin’ on you,” says
Josiah, “no danger on it.”</p>

<p>It was a long piece and he played and sung it in a
slow, and affectin’ manner. He then played and sung
the follerin’:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Come! oh come with me Miss Allen,</div>
<div class="verse i1">The moon is beaming;</div>
<div class="verse i1">Oh Tirzah; come with me,</div>
<div class="verse i1">The stars are gleaming;</div>
<div class="verse i1">All around is bright, with beauty teeming,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Moonlight hours&mdash;in my opinion&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse i1">Is the time for love.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i1">My skiff is by the shore,</div>
<div class="verse i1">She’s light, she’s free,</div>
<div class="verse i1">To ply the feathered oar Miss Allen,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Would be joy to me.</div>
<div class="verse i1">And as we glide along,</div>
<div class="verse i1">My song shall be,</div>
<div class="verse i1">(If you’ll excuse the liberty Tirzah)</div>
<div class="verse i1">I love but thee, I love but thee.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i1">Chorus&mdash;Tra la la Miss Tirzah,</div>
<div class="verse i10">Tra la la Miss Allen,</div>
<div class="verse i10">Tra la la, tra la la,</div>
<div class="verse i10">My dear young maid.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He then broke out into another piece, the chorus of
which was,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Curb oh curb thy bosom’s pain</div>
<div class="verse i1">I’ll come again, I’ll come again.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“No you won’t,” says Josiah, “you won’t never get
away, I <em>will</em> get up Samantha.”</p>

<p>Says I, in low but awful accents, “Josiah Allen, if
you make another move, I’ll part with you,” says I, “it
does beat all, how you keep actin’ to-night; haint it
as hard for me as it is for you? do you think it is any
comfort for me to lay here and hear it?” says I, “that
is jest the way with you men, you haint no more
patience than nothin’ in the world, you was young
once yourself.”</p>

<p>“Throw that in my face agin will you? what if I
<em>wuz</em>! Oh do hear him go on,” says he shakin’ his fist.
“‘Curb oh curb thy bosom’s pain,’ if I was out there
my young feller, I would give you a pain you couldn’t
curb so easy, though it might not be in your bosom.”</p>

<p>Says I “Josiah Allen, you have showed more wickedness
to-night, than I thought you had in you;” says
I “would you like to have your pastur, and Deacon
Dobbs, and sister Graves hear your revengeful threats?
if you was layin’ helpless on a sick bed would you be
throwin’ your arms about, and shakin’ your fist in that
way? it scares me to think a pardner of mine should
keep actin’ as you have,” says I “you have fell 25
cents in my estimation to-night.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” says he, “what comfort is there in his
prowlin’ round here, makin’ two old folks lay all night
in perfect agony?”</p>

<p>“It haint much after midnight, and if it was,” says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
I, in a deep and majestic tone. “Do you calculate,
Josiah Allen to go through life without any trouble?
if you do you will find yourself mistaken,” says I.
“Do be still.”</p>

<p>“I <em>won’t</em> be still Samantha.”</p>

<p>Just then he begun a new piece, durin’ which the
akordeun sounded the most meloncholly and cast down
it had yet, and his voice was solemn, and affectin’. I
never thought much of Shakespeare Bobbet. He is
about Thomas Jefferson’s age, his moustache is if possible
thinner than his’en, should say whiter, only that
is a impossibility. He is jest the age when he wants
to be older, and when folks are willin’ he should, for
you don’t want to call him Mr. Bobbet and to call him
“bub” as you always have, he takes as a deadly insult.
He thinks he is in love with Tirzah Ann, which is jest
as bad as long as it lasts as if he was; jest as painful
to him and to her. As I said he sung these words in
a slow and affectin’ manner.</p>

</div>

<p>He didn’t sing but one more piece after this. I
don’t remember the words for it was a long piece.
Josiah insists that it was as long as Milton’s Paradise
Lost.</p>

<p>Says I, “don’t be a fool Josiah, you never read it.”</p>

<p>“I have hefted the book,” says he, “and know the
size of it, and I know it was as long if not longer.”</p>

<p>Says I agin, in a cool collected manner, “don’t be a
fool Josiah, there wasn’t more than 25 or 30 verses at
the outside.” That was when we was talkin’ it over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to the breakfast table this mornin’, but I confess it did
seem awful long there in the dead of the night;
though I wouldn’t encourage Josiah by sayin’ so, he
loves the last word now, and I don’t know what he
would be if I encouraged him in it. I can’t remember
the words, as I said, but the chorus of each verse was</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh! I languish for thee, Oh! I languish for thee, wherever that I be,</div>
<div class="verse">Oh! Oh! Oh! I am languishin’ for thee, I am languishin’ for thee.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As I said I never set much store by Shakespeare
Bobbet, but truly everybody has their strong pints;
there was quavers put in there into them “Oh’s”
that never can be put in agin by anybody. Even
Josiah lay motionless listenin’ to ’em in a kind of awe.
Jest then we heard Thomas Jefferson speakin’ out of
the winder overhead.</p>

<p>“My musical young friend, haven’t you languished
enough for one night? Because if you have, father
and mother and I, bein’ kept awake by other serenaders
the forepart of the night, will love to excuse
you, will thank you for your labers in our behalf, and
love to bid you good evenin’, Tirzah Ann bein’ fast
asleep in the other end of the house. But don’t let
me hurry you Shakespeare, my dear young friend, if
you haint languished enough, you keep right on languishin’.
I hope I haint hard hearted enough to deny
a young man and neighbor the privilege of languishin’.”</p>

<p>I heard a sound of footsteps under the winder, followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
seemin’ly instantaneously by the rattlin’ of the
board fence at the extremity of the garden. Judgin’
from the sound, he must have got over the ground at
a rate seldom equaled and never outdone.</p>

<p>A button was found under the winder in the mornin’,
lost off we suppose by the impassioned beats of a
too ardent heart, and a too vehement pair of lungs,
exercised too much by the boldness and variety of the
quavers durin’ the last tune. That button and a few
locks of Malta fur, is all we have left to remind us of
our sufferin’s.</p>

<p>A few days before the 4th Betsey Bobbet come into
oure house in the mornin’ and says she,</p>

<p>“Have you heard the news?”</p>

<p>“No,” says I pretty brief, for I was jest puttin’ in
the ingrediences to a six quart pan loaf of fruit cake,
and on them occasions I want my mind cool and unruffled.</p>

<p>“Aspire Todd is goin’ to deliver the oration,” says
she.</p>

<p>“Aspire Todd! Who’s he?” says I cooly.</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen’s wife,” says she, “have you forgotten
the sweet poem that thrilled us so in the Jonesville
Gimlet a few weeks since?”</p>

<p>“I haint been thrilled by no poem,” says I with an
almost icy face pourin’ in my melted butter.</p>

<p>“Then it must be that you have never seen it, I
have it in my port-money and I will read it to you,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
says she, not heedin’ the dark froun gatherin’ on my
eye-brow, and she begun to read,</p>

<p>“How this sweet poem appeals to tender hearts,”
says Betsey as she concluded it.</p>

<p>“How it appeals to tender heads,” says I almost
coldly, measurin’ out my cinnamon in a big spoon.</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen’s wife, has not your soul never sailed
on that mystical sea he so sweetly depictures?”</p>

<p>“Not an inch,” says I firmly, “not an inch.”</p>

<p>“Have you not never been haunted by sorrowful
phantoms you would fain bury in oblivion’s sea?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not once,” says I “not a phantom,” and says I as
I measured out my raisons and English currants, “if
folks would work as I do, from mornin’ till night and
earn thier honest bread by the sweat of thier eyebrows,
they wouldn’t be tore so much by phantoms as they
be; it is your shiftless creeters that are always bein’
gored by phantoms, and havin’ ’em leer at ’em,” says
I with my spectacles bent keenly on her, “Why don’t
they leer at me Betsey Bobbet?”</p>

<p>“Because you are intellectually blind, you cannot
see.”</p>

<p>“I see enough,” says I, “I see more’n I want to a
good deal of the time.” In a dignified silence, I then
chopped my raisons impressively and Betsey started
for home.</p>

<p>The celebration was held in Josiah’s sugar bush,
and I meant to be on the ground in good season, for
when I have jobs I dread, I am for takin’ ’em by the
forelock and grapplin’ with ’em at once. But as I was
bakin’ my last plum puddin’ and chicken pie, the folks
begun to stream by, I hadn’t no idee thier could be so
many folks scairt up in Jonesville. I thought to myself,
I wonder if they’d flock out so to a prayer-meetin’.
But they kep’ a comin’, all kind of folks, in all kinds
of vehicles, from a 6 horse team, down to peacible
lookin’ men and wimmen drawin’ baby wagons, with
two babies in most of ’em.</p>

<p>There was a stagin’ built in most the middle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
grove for the leadin’ men of Jonesville, and some
board seats all round it for the folks to set on. As
Josiah owned the ground, he was invited to set upon
the stagin’.</p>

<p>And as I glanced up at that man every little while
through the day, I thought proudly to myself, there
may be nobler lookin’ men there, and men that would
weigh more by the steelyards, but there haint a whiter
shirt bosom there than Josiah Allen’s.</p>

<p>When I got there the seats was full. Betsey Bobbet
was jest ahead of me, and says she,</p>

<p>“Come on, Josiah Allen’s wife, let us have a seat,
we can obtain one, if we push and scramble enough.”
As I looked upon her carryin’ out her doctrine, pushin’
and scramblin’, I thought to myself, if I didn’t know
to the contrary, I never should take you for a modest
dignifier and retirer. And as I beheld her breathin’
hard, and her elboes wildly wavin’ in the air, pushin’
in between native men of Jonesville and foreigners, I
again methought, I don’t believe you would be so
sweaty and out of breath a votin’ as you be now. And
as I watched her labors and efforts I continued to
methink sadly, how strange! how strange! that retirin’
modesty and delicacy can stand so firm in some situations,
and then be so quickly overthrowed in others
seemin’ly not near so hard.</p>

<p>Betsey finally got a seat, wedged in between a large
healthy Irishman and a native constable, and she
motioned for me to come on, at the same time pokin’
a respectable old gentleman in front of her, with her
parasol, to make him move along. Says I,</p>

<p>“I may as well die one way as another, as well
expier a standin’ up, as in tryin’ to get a seat,” and I
quietly leaned up against a hemlock tree and composed
myself for events. A man heard my words which I
spoke about ½ to myself, and says he,</p>

<p>“Take my seat, mum.”</p>

<p>Says I “No! keep it.”</p>

<p>Says he “I am jest comin’ down with a fit, I have
got to leave the ground instantly.”</p>

<p>Says I “In them cases I will.” So I sot. His tongue
seemed thick, and his breath smelt of brandy, but
I make no insinuations.</p>

<p>About noon Prof. Aspire Todd walked slowly on to
the ground, arm in arm with the editor of the Gimlet,
old Mr. Bobbet follerin’ him closely behind. Countin’
2 eyes to a person, and the exceptions are triflin’,
there was 700 and fifty or sixty eyes aimed at him as
he walked through the crowd. He was dressed in a
new shinin’ suit of black, his complexion was deathly,
his hair was jest turned from white, and was combed
straight back from his forward and hung down long,
over his coat coller. He had a big moustache, about
the color of his hair, only bearin’ a little more on the
sandy, and a couple of pale blue eyes with a pair of
spectacles over ’em.</p>

<p>As he walked upon the stagin’ behind the Editer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the Gimlet, the band struck up, “Hail to the chief,
that in trihump advances.” As soon as it stopped
playin’ the Editer of the Gimlet come forward and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Fellow citizens of Jonesville and the adjacent and
surroundin’ world, I have the honor and privilege of
presenting to you the orator of the day, the noble and
eloquent Prof. Aspire Todd Esq.”</p>

<p>Prof. Todd came forward and made a low bow.</p>

<p>“Bretheren and sisters of Jonesville,” says he;
“Friends and patrons of Liberty, in risin’ upon this
aeroter, I have signified by that act, a desire and a
willingness to address you. I am not here fellow and
sister citizens, to outrage your feelings by triflin’
remarks, I am not here male patrons of liberty to lead
your noble, and you female patrons your tender footsteps
into the flowery fields of useless rhetorical eloquence;
I am here noble brothers and sisters of Jonesville
not in a mephitical manner, and I trust not in a
mentorial, but to present a few plain truths in a plain
manner, for your consideration. My friends we are
in one sense but tennifolious blossoms of life; or, if
you will pardon the tergiversation, we are all but mineratin’
tennirosters, hovering upon an illinition of
mythoplasm.”</p>

<p>“Jess so,” cried old Bobbet, who was settin’ on a
bench right under the speaker’s stand, with his fat red
face lookin’ up shinin’ with pride and enthusiasm, (and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the brandy he had took to honor the old Revolutionary
heroes) “Jess so! so we be!”</p>

<p>Prof. Todd looked down on him in a troubled kind
of a way for a minute, and then went on&mdash;</p>

<p>“Noble inhabitants of Jonesville and the rural districts,
we are actinolitic bein’s, each of our souls, like
the acalphia, radiates a circle of prismatic tentacles,
showing the divine irridescent essence of which composed
are they.”</p>

<p>“Jes’ so,” shouted old Bobbet louder than before.
“Jes’ so, so they did, I’ve always said so.”</p>

<p>“And if we are content to moulder out our existence,
like fibrous, veticulated, polypus, clingin’ to the
crustaceous courts of custom, if we cling not like soarin’
prytanes to the phantoms that lower thier sceptres
down through the murky waves of retrogression, endeavorin’
to lure us upward in the scale of progressive
bein’&mdash;in what degree do we differ from the accolphia?”</p>

<p>“Jes’ so,” says old Bobbet, lookin’ defiantly round
on the audience. “There he has got you, how can
they?”</p>

<p>Prof. Todd stopped again, looked doun on Bobbet,
and put his hand to his brow in a wild kind of a way,
for a minute, and then went on.</p>

<p>“Let us, noble brethren in the broad field of humanity,
let us rise, let us prove that mind is superior to
matter, let us prove ourselves superior to the acalphia&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, less,” says old Bobbet, “less prove ourselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let us shame the actinia,” said the Professor.</p>

<p>“Yes, jes’ so!” shouted old Bobbet, “less shame
him!” and in his enthusiasm he got up and hollered
agin, “Less shame him.”</p>

<p>Prof. Todd stopped stone still, his face red as blood,
he drinked several swallows of water, and then he
whispered a few words to the Editer of the Gimlet
who immegiately come forward and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Although it is a scene of touchin’ beauty, to see an
old gentleman, and a bald-headed one, so in love with
eloquence, and to give such remarkable proofs of it at
his age, still as it is the request of my young friend&mdash;and
I am proud to say ‘my young friend’ in regard
to one gifted in so remarkable a degree&mdash;at his request
I beg to be permitted to hint, that if the bald-headed
old gentleman in the linen coat can conceal his
admiration, and supress his applause, he will confer a
favor on my gifted young friend, and through him indirectly
to Jonesville, to America, and the great cause
of humanity, throughout the length and breadth of the
country.”</p>

<p>Here he made a low bow and sot down. Prof.
Todd continued his piece without any more interruption,
till most the last, he wanted the public of Jonesville
to “dround black care in the deep waters of oblivion,
mind not her mad throes of dissolvin’ bein’, but
let the deep waters cover her black head, and march
onward.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the old gentleman forgot himself, and sprang
up and hollered&mdash;</p>

<p>“Yes! dround the black cat, hold her head under!
What if she is mad! don’t mind her screamin’! there
will be cats enough left in the world! do as he tells
you to! less dround her!”</p>

<p>Prof. Todd finished in a few words, and set doun
lookin’ gloomy and morbid.</p>

<p>The next speaker was a large, healthy lookin’ man,
who talked aginst wimmin’s rights. He didn’t bring
up no new arguments, but talked as they all do who
oppose ’em. About wimmin outragin’ and destroyin’
thier modesty, by bein’ in the same street with a man
once every ’lection day. And he talked grand about
how woman’s weakness arroused all the shivelry and
nobility of a man’s nature, and how it was his dearest
and most sacred privilege and happiness, to protect
her from even a summer’s breeze, if it dared to blow
too hard on her beloved and delicate form.</p>

<p>Why, before he had got half through, a stranger
from another world who had never seen a woman,
wouldn’t have had the least idee that they was made
of clay as man was, but would have thought they was
made of some thin gauze, liable at any minute to blow
away, and that man’s only employment was to stand
and watch ’em, for fear some zephyr would get the
advantage of ’em. He called wimmin every pretty
name he could think of, and says he, wavin’ his hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
in the air in a rapped eloquence, and beatin’ his breast
in the same he cried,</p>

<p>“Shall these weak, helpless angels, these seraphines,
these sweet, delicate, cooin’ doves&mdash;whose only mission
it is to sweetly coo&mdash;these rainbows, these posys vote?
Never! my bretheren, never will we put such hardships
upon ’em.”</p>

<p>As he sot down, he professed himself and all the
rest of his sect ready to die at any time, and in any
way wimmin should say, rather than they should vote,
or have any other hardship. Betsey Bobbet wept
aloud, she was so delighted with it.</p>

<p>Jest as they concluded thier frantic cheers over his
speech, a thin, feeble lookin’ woman come by where I
stood, drawin’ a large baby wagon with two children
in it, seemin’ly a two-year-old, and a yearlin’. She
also carried one in her arms who was lame. She
looked so beat out and so ready to drop down, that I
got up and give her my seat, and says I,</p>

<p>“You look ready to fall down.”</p>

<p>“Am I too late,” says she, “to hear my husband’s
speech?”</p>

<p>“Is that your husband,” says I, “that is laughin’
and talkin’ with that pretty girl?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says she with a sort of troubled look.</p>

<p>“Well, he jest finished.”</p>

<p>She looked ready to cry, and as I took the lame
child from her breakin’ arms, says I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is too hard for you.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind gettin’ ’em on to the ground,”
says she, “I haint had only three miles to bring ’em,
that wouldn’t be much if it wasn’t for the work I had
to do before I come.”</p>

<p>“What did you have to do?” says I in pityin’ accents.</p>

<p>“Oh, I had to fix him off, brush his clothes and
black his boots, and then I did up all my work, and
then I had to go out and make six length of fence&mdash;the
cattle broke into the corn yesterday, and he was
busy writin’ his piece, and couldn’t fix it&mdash;and then I
had to mend his coat,” glancin’ at a thick coat in the
wagon. “He didn’t know but he should want it to
wear home, he knew he was goin’ to make a great effort,
and thought he should sweat some, he is dreadful
easy to take cold,” says she with a worried look.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he help you along with the children?”
says I, in a indignant tone.</p>

<p>“Oh, he said he had to make a great exertion to-day,
and he wanted to have his mind free and clear; he is
one of the kind that can’t have their minds trammeled.”</p>

<p>“It would do him good to be trammeled&mdash;hard!”
says I, lookin’ darkly on him.</p>

<p>“Don’t speak so of him,” says she beseechingly.</p>

<p>“Are you satisfied with his doin’s?” says I, lookin’
keenly at her.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” says she in a trustin’ tone, liftin’ her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
care-worn, weary countenance to mine, “oh yes, you
don’t know how beautiful he can <em>talk</em>.”</p>

<p>I said no more, for it is a invincible rule of my life,
not to make no disturbances in families. But I give
the yearlin’ pretty near a pound of candy on the spot,
and the glances I cast on <em>him</em> and the pretty girl he
was a flirtin’ with, was cold enough to freeze ’em both
into a male and female glazier.</p>

<p>Lawyer Nugent now got up and said, “That whereas
the speaking was foreclosed, or in other words finished,
he motioned they should adjourn to the dinner table,
as the fair committee had signified by a snowy signal
that fluttered like a dove of promise above waves of
emerald, or in plainer terms by a <em>towel</em>, that dinner was
forthcoming; whereas he motioned that they should
adjourn <i lang="la">sine die</i> to the aforesaid table.”</p>

<p>Old Mr. Bobbet, and the Editer of the Gimlet seconded
the motion at the same time. And Shakespeare
Bobbet wantin’ to do somethin’ in a public way, got
up and motioned “that they proceed to the table on the
usial road,” but there wasn’t any other way&mdash;only to
wade the creek&mdash;that didn’t seem to be necessary, but
nobody took no notice of it, so it was jest as well.</p>

<p class="caption">WHAT HAPPENED AT THE DINNER</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>The dinner was good, but there was an awful crowd
round the tables, and I was glad I wore my old lawn
dress, for the children was thick, and so was bread and
butter, and sass of all kinds, and jell tarts. And I
hain’t no shirk, I jest plunged right into the heat of
the battle, as you may say, waitin’ on the children, and
the spots on my dress skirt would have been too much
for anybody that couldn’t count 40. To say nothin’
about old Mr. Peedick steppin’ through the back
breadth, and Betsey Bobbet ketchin’ holt of me, and
rippin’ it off the waist as much as ½ a yard. And
then a horse started up behind the widder Tubbs, as I
was bendin’ down in front of her to get somethin’ out
of a basket, and she weighin’ above 200, was precipitated
onto my straw bonnet, jammin’ it down almost
as flat as it was before it was braided. I came off
pretty well in other respects, only about two yards of
the ruflin’ of my black silk cape was tore by two boys
who got to fightin’ behind me, and bein’ blind with
rage tore it off, thinkin’ they had got holt of each
other’s hair. There was a considerable number of
toasts drank, I can’t remember all of ’em, but among
’em was these,</p>

<p>“The eagle of Liberty; May her quills lengthen till
the proud shadow of her wings shall sweetly rest on
every land.”</p>

<p>“The 4th of July; the star which our old four fathers
tore from the ferocious mane of the howling lion of
England, and set in the calm and majestic brow of <i lang="la">E
pluribus unum</i>. May it gleam with brighter and
brighter radience, till the lion shall hide his dazzled
eyes, and cower like a stricken lamb at the feet of
<i lang="la">E pluribus</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dr. Bombus our respected citizen; how he tenderly
ushers us into a world of trial, and professionally and
scientifically assists us out of it. May his troubles
be as small as his morphine powders, and the circle
of his joys as well rounded as his pills.”</p>

<p>“The press of Jonesville, the Gimlet, and the Augur;
May they perforate the crust of ignorance with a gigantic
hole, through which blushing civilization can
sweetly peer into futurity.”</p>

<p>“The fair sect: first in war, first in peace, and first
in the hearts of their countrymen. May them that
love the aforesaid, flourish like a green bayberry tree,
whereas may them that hate them, dwindle down as
near to nothin’ as the bonnets of the aforesaid.”</p>

<p>That piece of toast was Lawer Nugent’s.</p>

<p>Prof. Aspire Todd’s was the last.</p>

<p>“The Luminous Lamp of Progression, whose sciatherical
shadows falling upon earthly matter, not promoting
sciolism, or Siccity, may it illumine humanity as
it tardigradely floats from matter’s aquius wastes, to
minds majestic and apyrous climes.”</p>

<p>Shakspeare Bobbet then rose up, and says he,</p>

<p>“Before we leave this joyous grove I have a poem
which I was requested to read to you, it is dedicated
to the Goddess of Liberty, and was transposed by another
female, who modestly desires her name not to be
mentioned any further than the initials B. B.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
He then read the follerin’ spirited lines:</p>

<p>The picknick never broke up till most night, I went
home a little while before it broke, and if there was a
beat out creeter, I was; I jest dropped my delapidated
form into a rockin’ chair with a red cushien and says I,</p>

<p>“There needn’t be another word said, I will never
go to another 4th as long as my name is Josiah Allen’s
wife.”</p>

<p>“You haint patriotic enough Samantha,” says Josiah,
“you don’t love your country.”</p>

<p>“What good has it done the nation to have me all
tore to pieces?” says I, “Look at my dress, look at my
bonnet and cape, any one ought to be a iron clad to
stand it, look at my dishes!” says I.</p>

<p>“I guess the old heroes of the Revolution went
through more than that,” says Josiah.</p>

<p>“Well I haint a old hero!” says I coolly.</p>

<p>“Well you can honor ’em can’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“Honor ’em! Josiah Allen what good has it done
to old Mr. Layfayette to have my new earthern pie
plates smashed to bits, and a couple of tines broke off
of one of my best forks? What good has it done to
old Thomas Jefferson, to have my lawn dress tore off
of me by Betsey Bobbet? what benefit has it been to
John Adams, or Isaac Putnam to have old Peedick step
through it? what honor has it been to George Washington
to have my straw bonnet flatted down tight to
my head? I am sick of this talk about honorin’, and
liberty and duty, I am sick of it,” says I “folks will
make a pack horse of duty, and ride it to circuses,
and bull fights, if we had ’em. You may talk about
honorin’ the old heroes and goin’ through all these performances
to please ’em. But if they are in Heaven
they can get along without heerin’ the Jonesville brass
band, and if they haint, they are probably where fireworks
haint much of a rarity to ’em.”</p>

<p>Josiah quailed before my lofty tone and I relapsed
into a weary and delapidated silence.</p>

FOREBODIN’S.</h2>

<p>Two or three weeks after this, Thomas Jefferson
went to the school house to meetin’ one Sunday
night, and he broke out to the breakfast table the next
mornin’&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mother, I am sick of the Jews,” says he, “I should
think the Jews had a hard enough time a wanderin’
for 40 years, it seems to me if I was in minister’s
places I would let ’em rest a little while now, and go
to preachin’ to livin’ sinners, when the world is full
of ’em. There was two or three drunkards there last
night, a thief, four hypocrites, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“One little conceited creeter that thinks he knows
more than his old minister,” says I in a rebukin’ tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, I noticed Shakespeare Bobbet was there,”
says he calmly. “But wouldn’t it have been better,
mother, to have preached to these livin’ sinners that
are goin to destruction round him, and that ought to
be chased up, and punched in the side with the Gospel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
than to chase round them old Jews for an hour
and a half? Them old men deserve rest, and ought
to have it.”</p>

<p>Says I, “Elder Wesley Minkley used ’em as a
means of grace to carry his hearers towards heaven.”</p>

<p>Says Thomas, “I can go out in the woods alone, and
lay doun and look up to the sky, and get nearer to
heaven, than I can by follerin’ up them old dead
Jews.”</p>

<p>Says I in awful earnest tones, “Thomas Jefferson,
you are gettin’ into a dangerous path,” says I, “don’t
let me hear another word of such talk; we should all
be willin’ to bear our crosses.”</p>

<p>“I am willin’ to bear any reasonable cross, mother,
but I hate to tackle them old Jews and shoulder ’em,
for there don’t seem to be any need of it.”</p>

<p>I put on about as cold a look onto my face as I
could under the circumstances, (I had been fryin’ buckwheat
pancakes,) and Thomas J. turned to his father&mdash;</p>

<p>“Betsey Bobbet talked in meetin’ last night after
the sermon, father, she said she knew that she was
religious, because she felt that she loved the bretheren.”</p>

<p>Josiah laughed, the way he encourages that boy is
awful, but I spoke in almost frigid tones, as I passed
him his 3d cup of coffee,</p>

<p>“She meant it in a scriptural sense, of course.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’d think she meant it in a earthly sense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
if you had seen her hang on to old Slimpsey last night,
she’ll marry that old man yet, if he don’t look out.”</p>

<p>“Oh shaw!” says I coolly, “she is payin’ attention
to the Editer of the Augur.”</p>

<p>“She’ll never get him,” says he; “she means to be
on the safe side, and get one or the other of ’em; how
stiddy she has been to meetin’ sense old Slimpsey
moved into the place.”</p>

<p>“You shall not make light of her religion, Thomas
Jefferson,” says I, pretty severely.</p>

<p>“I won’t, mother, I shouldn’t feel right to, for it is
light enough now, it don’t all consist in talkin’ in
meetin’, mother. I don’t believe in folks’es usin’ up
all their religion Sunday nights, and then goin’ without
any all the rest of the week, it looks as shiftless in
’em as a three-year-old hat on a female. The religion
that gets up on Sunday nights, and then sets down all
the rest of the week, I don’t think much of.”</p>

<p>Says I in a tone of deep rebuke, “Instead of tendin’
other folks’es motes, Thomas Jefferson, you had better
take care of your own beams, you’ll have plenty work,
enough to last you one spell.”</p>

<p>“And if you have got through with your breakfast,”
says his father, “you had better go and fodder the
cows.”</p>

<p>Thomas J. arose with alacraty and went to the barn,
and his father soon drew on his boots and follered him,
and with a pensive brow I turned out my dishwater.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
I hadn’t got my dishes more than half done, when with
no warnin’ of no kind, the door bust open, and in tottered
Simon Slimpsey, pale as a piece of a white cotton
shirt. I wildly wrung out my dishcloth, and offered
him a chair, sayin’ in a agitated tone, “What is
the matter, Simon Slimpsey?”</p>

<p>“Am I pursued?” says he in a voice of low frenzy,
as he sunk into a wooden bottomed chair. I cast one
or two eagle glances out of the window, both ways,
and replied in a voice of choked doun emotion,</p>

<p>“There haint nobody in sight; has your life been
attackted by burglers and incindiarys? speak, Simon
Slimpsey, speak!”</p>

<p>He struggled nobly for calmness, but in vain, and
then he put his hand wildly to his brow, and murmured
in low and hollow accents&mdash;</p>

<p>“Betsey Bobbet.”</p>

<p>I see he was overcome by as many as six or seven
different emotions of various anguishes, and I give
him pretty near a minute to recover himself, and then
says I as I sadly resumed my dishcloth,</p>

<p>“What of her, Simon Slimpsey?”</p>

<p>“She’ll be the death on me,” says he, “and that
haint the worst on it, my sole is jeopardized on account
of her. Oh,” says he, groanin’ in a anguish, “could
you believe it, Miss Allen, that I&mdash;a member of a Authodox
church and the father of 13 small children&mdash;could
be tempted to swear? Behold that wretch. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
I come through your gate jest now, I said to myself
‘By Jupiter, I can’t stand it so, much longer.’ And
last night I wished I was a ghost, for I thought if I
was a apperition I could have escaped from her view.
Oh,” says he, groanin’ agin, “I have got so low as to
wish I was a ghost.”</p>

<p>He paused, and in a deep and almost broodin’
silence, I finished my dishes, and hung up my dishpan.</p>

<p>“She come rushin’ out of Deacon Gowdey’s, as I
come by jest now, to talk to me, she don’t give me no
peace, last night she would walk tight to my side all
the way home, and she looked hungry at the gate, as
I went through and fastened it on the inside.”</p>

<p>Agin he paused overcome by his emotions, and I
looked pityingly on him. He was a small boned man
of about seventy summers and winters. He was
always a weak, feeble, helpless critter, a kind of a
underlin’ always. He never had any morals, he got
out of morals when he was a young man, and haint
been able to get any sense. He has always drinked a
good deal of liquor, and has chawed so much tobacco
that his mouth looks more like a old yellow spitoon
than anything else. As I looked sadly on him I see
that age, who had ploughed the wrinkles into his face,
had turned the furrows deep. The cruel fingers of
time, or some other female, had plucked nearly every
hair from his head, and the ruthless hand of fate had
also seen fit to deprive him of his eye winkers, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
one solitary winker bein’ left for a shade tree (as it
were) to protect the pale pupils below; and they bein’
a light watery blue, and the lids bein’ inflamed, they
looked sad indeed.
Owin’ to afflictive providences
he was dressed
up more than men
generally be, for his
neck bein’ badly swelled
he wore a string
of amber beads, and
in behalf of his sore
eyes he wore ear rings.
But truly outside
splendor and glitter
won’t satisfy the mind,
and bring happiness.
I looked upon his
mournful face, and my heart melted inside of me,
almost as soft as it could, almost as soft as butter in
the month of August. And I said to him in a soothin’
and encouragin’ tone,</p>

<p>“Mebby she will marry the Editer of the Augur,
she is payin’ attention to him.”</p>

<p>“No she won’t,” says he in a solemn and affectin’
way, that brought tears to my eyes as I sot peelin’ my
onions for dinner. “No she won’t, I shall be the one,
I feel it. I was always the victim, I was always down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
trodden. When I was a baby my mother had two
twins, both of ’em a little older than me, and they
almost tore me to pieces before I got into trowses.
Mebby it would have been better for me if they had,”
says he in a mewsin’ and mournful tone&mdash;I knew he
thought of Betsey then&mdash;and heavin’ a deep sigh he
resumed,</p>

<p>“When I went to school and we played leap frog,
if there was a frog to be squshed down under all the
rest, I was that frog. It has always been so&mdash;if there
was ever a underlin’ and a victim wanted, I was that
underlin’ and that victim. And Betsey Bobbet will
get round me yet, you see if she don’t, wimmen are
awful perseverin’ in such things.”</p>

<p>“Cheer up Simon Slimpsey, you haint obleeged to
marry her, it is a free country, folks haint obleeged to
marry unless they are a mind to, it don’t take a brass
band to make that legal.” I quoted these words in a
light and joyous manner hopin’ to rouse him from his
dispondancy, but in vain, for he only repeated in a
gloomy tone,</p>

<p>“She’ll get round me yet, Miss Allen, I feel it.”
And as the dark shade deepened on his eye brow he
said,</p>

<p>“Have you seen her verses in the last week’s
Augur?”</p>

<p>“No,” says I “I haint.”</p>

<p>In a silent and hopeless way, he took the paper out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of his pocket and handed it to me and I read as follers:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Wall,” says I in a encouragin’ tone, “that haint
much different from the piece she printid a week or
two ago, that was about woman’s spear.”</p>

<p>“It is that spear that is a goin’ to destroy me,” says
he mournfully,</p>

you lookin’ so gloomy and depressted.”</p>

<p>“It is the awful detarmination these lines breathe
forth that appauls me,” says he. “I have seen it in
another. Betsey Bobbet reminds me dreadfully of
another. And I don’t want to marry again Miss Allen,
I don’t want to,” says he lookin’ me pitifully in the
face, “I didn’t want to marry the first time, I wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
to be a bachelder, I think they have the easiest time
of it, by half. Now there is a friend of mine, that
never was married, he is jest my age, or that is, he is
only half an hour younger, and that haint enough difference
to make any account of, is it Miss Allen?” says
he in a pensive, and enquirin’ tone.</p>

<p>“No,” says I in a reasonable accent. “No, Simon
Slimpsey, it haint.”</p>

<p>“Wall that man has always been a bachelder, and
you ought to see what a head of hair he has got, sound
at the roots now, not a lock missing. I wanted to be
one, she, my late wife, came and kept house for me
and married me. I lived with her for 18 years, and
when she left me,” he murmured with a contented look,
“I was reconciled to it. I was reconciled for sometime
before it took place. I don’t want to say anything
against nobody that haint here, but I lost some hair by
my late wife,” says he puttin’ his hand to his bald head
in a abstracted way, as gloomy reflections crowded onto
him, “I lost a good deal of hair by her, and I haint
much left as you can see,” says he in a meloncholy
way “I did want to save a lock or two for my children
to keep, as a relict of me. I have 13 children as
you know, countin’ each pair of twins as two, and it
would take a considerable number of hairs to go round.”
Agin he paused overcome by his feelin’s, I knew not
what to say to comfort him, and I poured onto him a
few comfortin’ adjectives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mebby you are borrowin’ trouble without a cause

the darkest before daylight.” But in vain. He only
sighed mournfully.</p>

<p>“She’ll get round me yet Miss Allen, mark my
words, and when the time comes you will think of
what I told you.” His face was most black with
gloomy aprehension, as he reflected agin. “You see
if she don’t get round me!” and a tear began to flow.</p>

<p>I turned away with instinctive delicacy and sot my
pan of onions in the sink, but when I glanced at him
agin it was still flowin’. And I said to him in a tone
of about two thirds pity and one comfort,</p>

<p>“Chirk up, Simon Slimpsey, be a man.”</p>

<p>“That is the trouble,” says he “if I wasn’t a man,
she would give me some peace.” And he wept into
his red silk handkerchief (with a yellow border) bitterly.</p>

<h2 id="FREE_LOVE_LECTURES">FREE LOVE LECTURES.</h2>

<p>It was a beautiful mornin’ in October. The trees
in the woods nigh by, had all got their new fall
suits on, red and purple and orange, while further back,
the old hills seemed to be a settin’ up with a blue gauze
vail on. There was a little mite of a breeze blowin’
up through the orchard, where the apples lay in red
and yellow heaps in the green grass. Everything
looked so beautiful and fresh, that as I went out on
the doorstep to shake the table-cloth, my heart fairly
sung for joy. And I exclaimed to Josiah in clear,
happy tones,</p>

<p>“What a day it is, Josiah, to gather the winter apples
and pull the beets.”</p>

<p>He says, “Yes, Samantha, and after you get your
work done up, don’t you s’pose you could come out
and pick up apples a spell?”</p>

<p>I told him in the same cheerful tones I had formally
used, “that I would, and that I would hurry up my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
dishes as fast as I could, and come out.”</p>

<p>But alas! how little do we know what trial a hour
may bring forth; this hour brought forth Betsey Bobbet.
As I went to the door to throw out my dishwater,
I see her comin’ through the gate. I controlled
myself pretty well, and met her with considerable
calmness. She was in awful good spirits. There had
been a lecture on Free Love to Jonesville; Prof. Theron
Gusher had been a lecturin’ there, and Betsey had
attended to it, and was all full of the idee. She begun
almost before she sot down, and says she,</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen’s wife you can’t imagine what new and
glorious and soaring ideahs that man has got into his
head.”</p>

<p>“Let him soar,” says I coldly, “it don’t hurt me.”</p>

<p>Says she, “He is too soaring a soul to be into this
cold unsympathizing earth, he ought by good right to
be in a warmeh speah.”</p>

<p>Says I coldly, and almost frigidly, “From what I
have heard of his lecture I think so too, a good deal
warmer.”</p>

<p>Says she, “He was to our house yesterday, he said
he felt dreadful drawed to me, a kind of a holy drawing
you know, I neveh saw such a saintly, heavenly
minded man in my life. Why he got into such a
spirutal state&mdash;when motheh went out of the room a
minute&mdash;he kissed me moah than a dozen times; that
man is moah than half a angel, Josiah Allen’s wife.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>I gave her a look that pierced like sheet lightnin’
through her tow frizzles and went as much as half
through her brain.</p>

<p>“Haint Theron Gusher a married man?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, some.”</p>

<p>“Some!” I repeated in a cold accent, “He is
either married or he haint married one or the other,”
and again I repeated coldly “is he a married man
Betsey?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, he has been married a few times, or what
the cold world calls marrying&mdash;he has got a wife now,
but I do not believe he has found his affinity yet,
though he has got several bills of divorcement from
various different wimmen trying to find her. That
<em>may</em> be his business to Jonesville, but it does not
become me to speak of it.”</p>

<p>Says I “Betsey Bobbet!” and I spoke in a real
solemn camp meetin’ tone, for I was talkin’ on deep
principle; says I, “you say he is a married man&mdash;and
now to say nothin’ of your own modesty if you have
got any and stand up onto clear principle, how would
you like to have your husband if you had one, round
kissin’ other wimmen?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” says she, “His wife will neveh know it,
neveh!”</p>

<p>“If it is such a pious, heavenly, thing, why not tell
her of it?”</p>

<p>“Oh Prof. Gusheh says that some natures are too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
gross and earthly to comprehend how souls can meet,
scorning and forgetting utterly those vile, low, clay
bodies of ours. He does not think much of these clay
bodies anyway.”</p>

<p>“These clay bodies are the best we have got,” says
I, “And we have got to stay in ’em till we die, and the
Lord tells us to keep ’em pure, so he can come and
visit us in ’em. I don’t believe the Lord thinks much
of these holy drawin’s. I know I don’t.”</p>

<p>Betsey sot silently twistin’ her otter colored bonnet
strings, and I went on, for I felt it was my duty.</p>

<p>“Married men are jest as good as them that haint
married for lots of purposes, such as talkin’ with on
the subject of religeon, and polytix and miscelanious
subjects, and helpin’ you out of a double wagon, and
etcetery. But when it comes to kissin’, marryin’ spiles
men in my opinion for kissin’ any other woman only
jest their own wives.”</p>

<p>“But suppose a man has a mere clay wife?” says
Betsey.</p>

<p>Says I, “Betsey, Josiah Allen was goin’ to buy a
horse the other day that the man said was a 3 year
old; he found by lookin’ at her teeth that she was
pretty near 40; Josiah didn’t buy it. If a man don’t
want to marry a clay woman, let him try to find one
that haint clay. I think myself that he will have a
hard time to find one, but he has a perfect right to
hunt as long as he is a mind to&mdash;let him,” says I in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
liberal tone. “Let him hire a horse and sulkey, and
search the country over and over. I don’t care if he
is 20 years a huntin’ and comparin’ wimmin a tryin’
to find one to suit him. But when he once makes up
his mind, I say let him stand by his bargain, and make
the best of it, and not try afterwards to look at her
teeth.”</p>

<p>Betsey still sot silently twistin’ her bunnet strings,
but I see that she was a mewsin’ on some thought of
her own, and in a minute or so she broke out: “Oh,
what a soaring sole Prof. Gusheh is; he soared in his
lecture to that extent that it seemed as if he would
lift me right up, and carry me off.”</p>

<p>For a minute I thought of Theron Gusher with
respect, and then agin my eye fell sadly upon Betsey,
and she went on,</p>

<p>“I came right home and wrote a poem on the subject,
and I will read it to you.” And before I could
say a word to help myself, she begun to read.</p>

<p>“You see it repeats some,” says Betsey as she finished
readin’. “But Prof. Gusheh wanted me to write
a him to sing at thier Free Love conventions, and he
wanted a chorus to each verse, a sort of a war-cry, that
all could join in and help sing, and he says these soul
stirrin’ lines:</p>

<p class="noindent">have got the true ring to them. I had to kind o’ speak
against men in it. I hated too, awfully, but Prof.
Gusheh said it would be necessary, in ordeh to rouse
the masses. He says the almost withering sarcasm of
this noble song is just what they need. He says it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
will go down to posterity side by side with Yankee
Doodle, if not ahead of it. I know by his countenance
that he thought it was superior to Mr. Doodle’s him.
But what think you of it, Josiah Allen’s wife?”</p>

<p>“I think,” says I in a cautious tone, “that it is
about off’n’ a piece with the subject.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think Josiah Allen’s wife that it would
be real sweet to get bills from men. It is a glorious
doctrine for wimmen, so freein’ and liberatin’ to them.”</p>

<p>“Sweet!” says I hautily “it would be a pretty
world wouldn’t it Betsey Bobbet, if every time a woman
forgot to put a button onto a shirt, her husband
would start up and say she wasn’t his affinitee, and go
to huntin’ of her up, or every time his collar choked
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but wimmen could hunt too!”</p>

<p>“Who would take care of the children, if they was
both a huntin’?” says I sternly, “it would be a hard
time for the poor little innocents, if there father and
mother was both of ’em off a huntin’.”</p>

<p>Before I could free my mind any further about Prof.
Gusher and his doctrine, I had a whole houseful of
company come, and Betsey departed. But before she
went she told me that Prof. Gusher had heard that I
was in faver of wimmen’s rights and he was comin’ to
see me before he left Jonesville.</p>

<p>The next day he came. Josiah was to the barn a
thrashin’ beans, but I received him with a calm dignity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
He was a harmless lookin’ little man, with his
hair combed and oiled as smooth as a lookin’ glass.
He had on a bell-crouned
hat which he lifted
from his head with a
smile as I come to the
door. He wore a plad
jacket, and round his
neck and hangin’ doun
his bosom was a bright
satten scarf into which
he had stuck 2 big headed
pins with a chain
hitched onto each of ’em, and he had a book under his
arm. He says to me most the first thing after he sot
down,</p>

<p>“You believe in wimmin havin’ a right don’t you?”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;" id="illus27">
<img src="images/illus27.jpg" width="250" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PROFESSOR GUSHER.</p>
</div>

<p>“Yes Sir,” says I keenly lookin’ up from my knitin’
work. “Jest as many rights as she can get holt of,
rights never hurt any body yet.”</p>

<p>“Worthy statements,” says he. “And you believe
in Free Love, do you not?”</p>

<p>“How free?” says I cooly.</p>

<p>“Free to marry any body you want to, and as long
as you want to, from half a day, up to 5 years or so.”</p>

<p>“No Sir!” says I sternly, “I believe in rights, but
I don’t believe in wrongs, of all the miserable doctrines
that was ever let loose on the world, the doctrine of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Free Love is the miserable’st. Free Love!” I repeated
in indignant tones, “it ought to be called free devlitry,
that is the right name for it.”</p>

<p>He sunk right back in his chair, put his hand wildly
to his brow and exclaimed,</p>

<p>“My soul aches, I thought I had found a congenial
spirit, but I am decieved, my breast aches, and siths,
and pants.” He looked so awful distressed, that I
didn’t know what did ail him, and I looked pityin’ on
him from over my spectacles and I says to him jest as
I would to our Thomas Jefferson,</p>

<p>“Mebby your vest is too tight.”</p>

<p>“Vest!” he repeated in wild tones, “would I had
no worse trammels than store clothes, but it is the
fate of reformers to be misunderstood. Woman the
pain is deeper and it is a gnawin’ me.”</p>

<p>His eyes was kinder rolled, and he looked so wilted
and uncomfortable, that I says to him in still more
pityin’ accents,</p>

<p>“Haint you got wind on your stummuck, for if
you have, peppermint essence is the best stuff you can
take, and I will get you some.”</p>

<p>“Wind!” he almost shouted, “wind! no, it is not
wind,” he spoke so deleriously that he almost skairt
me, but I kep’ up my placid demeaner, and kep’ on
knittin’.</p>

<p>“Wimmen,” said he, “I would right the wrongs
of your sect if I could. I bear in my heart the woes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and pains of all the aching female hearts of the 19
centurys.”</p>

<p>My knittin’ dropped into my lap, and I looked up at
him in surprise, and I says to him respectfully,</p>

<p>“No wonder you groan and sithe, it must hurt
awfully.”</p>

<p>“It does hurt,” says he, “but it hurts a sensitive
spirit worse to have it mistook for wind.”</p>

<p>He see my softened face, and he took advantage of
it, and went on.</p>

<p>“Woman, you have been married, you say, goin’ on
15 years; hain’t you never felt slavish in that time,
and felt that you would gladly unbind yourself?”</p>

<p>“Never!” says I firmly, “never! I don’t want to
be unbound.”</p>

<p>“Hain’t you never had longings, and yearnings to
be free?”</p>

<p>“Not a yearn,” says I calmly, “not a yearn. If
I had wanted to remain free I shouldn’t have give my
heart and hand to Josiah Allen. I didn’t do it deleriously,
I had my senses.” Says I, “you can’t set down
and stand up at the same time, each situation has its
advantages, but you can’t be in both places at once,
and this tryin’ to, is what makes so much trouble
amongst men and wimmen. They want the rights
and advantages of both stations to once&mdash;they want to
set down and stand up at the same time, and it can’t
be did. Men and wimmen hain’t married at the pint
of the bayonet, they go into it with both their eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
open. If anybody thinks they are happier, and freer
from care without bein’ married, nobody compels ’em
to be married, but if they are, they hadn’t ought to
want to be married and single at the same time, it is
onreasonable.”</p>

<p>He looked some convinced, and I went on in a softer
tone,</p>

<p>“I hain’t a goin’ to say that Josiah hain’t been tryin’
a good many times. He has raved round some, when
dinner wasn’t ready, and gone in his stockin’ feet considerable,
and been slack about kindlin’ wood. Likewise
I have my failin’s. I presume I hain’t done
always exactly as I should about shirt buttons, mebby
I have scolded more’n I ort to about his keepin’ geese.
But if men and wimmen think they are marryin’
angels, they’ll find out they’ll have to settle down and
keep house with human critters. I never see a year
yet, that didn’t have more or less winter in it, but
what does it say, ‘for better, for worse,’ and if it turns
out more worse than better, why that don’t part us, for
what else does it say? ‘Till death does us part,’ and
what is your little slip of paper that you call a bill to
that? Is that death?” says I.</p>

<p>He quailed silently, and I proceeded on.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t give a cent for your bills, I had jest as
lives walk up and marry any married man, as to marry
a man with a bill. I had jest as lives,” says I warmin’
with my subject, “I had jest as lives join a Mormon
at once. How should I feel, to know there was another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
woman loose in the world, liable to walk in here any
minute and look at Josiah, and to know all that separated
’em was a little slip of paper about an inch wide?”</p>

<p>My voice was loud and excited, for I felt deeply
what I said, and says he in soothin’ tones,</p>

<p>“I presume that you and your husband are congenial
spirits, but what do you think of soarin’ soles,
that find out when it is too late that they are wedded
to mere lumps of clay.”</p>

<p>I hadn’t fully recovered from my excited frame of
mind, and I replied warmly, “I never see a man yet
that wasn’t more or less clay, and to tell you the truth
I think jest as much of these clay men as I do of these
soarers, I never had any opinion of soarers at all.”</p>

<p>He sank back in his chair and sithed, for I had
touched him in a tender place, but still clinging to
his free love doctrine, he murmered faintly,</p>

<p>“Some wimmen are knocked down by some men,
and dragged out.”</p>

<p>His meek tones touched my feelin’s, and I continued
in more reasonable accents.</p>

<p>“Mebby if I was married to a man that knocked
me down and dragged me out frequently, I would
leave him a spell, but not one cent would I invest in
another man, not a cent. I would live alone till he
came to his senses, if he ever did, and if he didn’t,
why when the great roll is called over above, I would
answer to the name I took when I loved him and
married him, hopin’ his old love would come back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
again there, and we would have all eternity to keep
house in.”</p>

<p>He looked so depressted, as he sot leanin’ back in
his chair, that I thought I had convinced him, and he
was sick of his business, and I asked him in a helpful
way,</p>

<p>“Hain’t there no other business you can get into,
besides preachin’ up Free Love? Hain’t there no
better business? Hain’t there no cornfields where
you could hire out for a scare-crow&mdash;can’t you get to
be United States Senator? Hain’t there no other
mean job not quite so mean as this, you could get into?”</p>

<p>He didn’t seem to take it friendly in me, you know
friendly advice makes some folks mad. He spoke out
kinder surly and says he, “I hain’t done no hurt, I
only want everybody to find their affinitee.”</p>

<p>That riled up the blood in me, and says I with
spirit,</p>

<p>“Say that word to me agin if you dare.” Says I
“of all the mean words a married woman ever listened
to, that is the meanest,” says I “if you say “affinitee”
here in my house, agin, young man, I will holler to
Josiah.”</p>

<p>He see I was in earnest and deeply indignent, and
he ketched up his hat and cane, and started off, and
glad enough was I to see him go.</p>

<h2 id="ELDER_WESLEY_MINKLES_DONATION">ELDER WESLEY MINKLE’S DONATION
PARTY.</h2>

<p>About four weeks afterwards, I had got my kitchen
mopped out, clean as a pin and everything in perfect
order and the dinner started, (I was goin’ to have
beef steak and rice puddin’,) and then I took a bowl
of raisons and sot doun to stun ’em, for I was goin’ to
bake a plum cake for supper. I will have good vittles
as long as my name is Josiah Allen’s wife. And it
haint only on my own account that I do it, but I do it
as I have observed before, from deep and almost
cast iron principle. For as the greatest of philosiphers
have discovered, if a woman would keep her table
spread out from year to year, and from hour to hour,
filled with good vittles, that woman would have a
clever set of men folks round.</p>

<p>As I sot serenely stunnin’ my raisons, not dreamin’
of no trouble, I heard a rap at the door, and in walked
Betsey Bobbet. I see she looked kinder curious, but I
didn’t say nothin’, only I asked her to take off her
things. She complied, and as she took out her tattin’
and begun to tat, says she&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have come to crave your advise, Josiah Allen’s
wife. I am afraid I have been remissin’ in my duty.
Martin Farquar Tupper is one of the most sweetest
poets of the ages. My sentiments have always
blended in with his beautiful sentiments, I have
always flew with his flights, and soahed with his
soahs. And last night afteh I had retiahed to bed, one
of his sublime ideahs come to me with a poweh I neveh
befoah felt. It knocked the bolted doah of my
heart open, and said in low and hollow tones as it entered
in, ‘Betsey Bobbet, you have not nevah done
it.’”</p>

<p>Betsey stopped a minute here for me to look surprised
and wonderin’, but I didn’t, I stunned my raisons
with a calm countenance, and she resumed&mdash;</p>

<p>“Deah Tuppah remarks that if anybody is goin’ to be
married, thier future companion is upon the earth somewhere
at the present time, though they may not have
met him or her. And he says it is our duty to pray
for that future consort. And Josiah Allen’s wife, I
have not neveh done it.”</p>

<p>She looked agonized, as she repeated to me, “Josiah
Allen’s wife, I have neveh preyed for him a word. I
feel condemned; would you begin now?”</p>

<p>Says I coolly, “Are you goin’ to prey <em>for</em> a husband,
or <em>about</em> one?”</p>

<p>Says she mournfully, “A little of both.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” says I in a cautious way, “I don’t know
as it would do any hurt, Betsey.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Says she, “I will begin to prey to-night. But that
is not all I wished to crave your advise about. Folks
must work as well as prey. Heaven helps them that
help themselves. I am goin’ to take a decided stand.”
Then she broke off kinder sudden, and says she, “Be
you a goin’ to the Faih and Donation to the Methodist
church to-morrow night?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says I, “I am a layin’ out to go.”</p>

<p>“Well, Josiah Allen’s wife, will you stand by me?
There is not another female woman in Jonesville that
I have the firm unwaverin’ confidence in, that I have
in you. You always bring about whateveh you set
youh hands to do&mdash;and I want to know, will you
stand by me to-morrow night?”</p>

<p>Says I in a still more cautious tone “what undertakin’
have you got into your head now, Betsey Bobbet?”</p>

<p>“I am going to encourage the Editah of the Augah.
That man needs a companion. Men are bashful and
offish, and do not always know what is the best for
them. I have seen horses hang back on the harness
before now, I have seen geese that would not walk
up to be picked. I have seen children hang back
from pikery. The horses ought to be made to go!
The geese ought to be held and picked! The
children ought to take the pikery if you have to hold
thieh noses to make them. The Editah of the Augah
<em>needs</em> a companion, I am going to encourage that man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
to-morrer night and I want to know Josiah Allen’s
wife if you will stand by me.”</p>

<p>I answered her in reasonable tones. “You know
Betsey that I can’t run, I am too fat, and then I am
gettin’ too old. Mebby I might walk up and help
you corner him, but you know I can’t run for anybody.”</p>

<p>Jest then Josiah came in and the conversation
dropped down viz: on the fare. Says Josiah, says
he, “Brother Wesley Minkley is a honest, pure minded
man and I shall go, and shall give accordin’ to my
ability, but I
don’t believe in
’em, I don’t believe
in doin’ so
much for ministers.
The bible
says let them live
on the gospel;
why don’t they?
The old ’postles
wasn’t always
havin’ donations
and fares to get
up money for ’em,
and big sallerys.
Why don’t they live like the ’postles?”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;" id="illus28">
<img src="images/illus28.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LIVIN’ ON GOSPEL.</p>
</div>

<p>Says I, “Josiah Allen you try to live on clear gospel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
a spell, and see if your stommack wouldn’t feel kinder
empty.” Says I, “The bible says the ‘Laborer is
worthy of his hire.’” Says I, “folks are willin’ to pay
their doctors and lawyers, and druggers, and their tin-peddlers,
and every body else only ministers, and if
any body has a slave’s life, it is a good conscientious
minister.” Says I, “Brother Wesley Minkley works
like a dog.”</p>

<p>“I don’t deny it,” says Josiah, “but why don’t he
live like the ’postle Paul?”</p>

<p>Says I, “the ’postle Paul didn’t have to buy 40 or
50 yards of merymac callico and factory cloth every
year. He didn’t have to buy cradles and cribs, and
soothin’ syrup, for he didn’t have any babys to be
cribbed and soothed. He didn’t have to buy bunnets,
and gographys, and prunella gaters, and back combs,
and hair pins, and etcetery, etcetery. He didn’t have
a wife and seven daughters and one son, as Brother
Wesley Minkley has got.” Says I, almost warmly,
“Every other man, only jest ministers, has a hope of
layin’ up a little somethin’ for their children, but <em>they</em>
don’t think of doin’ that, all <em>they</em> expect is to keep
’em alive and covered up,” and says I, “The congregation
they almost slave themselves to death for, begrech
that, and will jaw too if they hain’t covered up, and
dressed up slick. Sister Minkley wants her girls to
look as well as the rest of the girls in the Church.”
Says I, “The ’postle Paul wasn’t a mother, Josiah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
not that I have anything against him,” says I more
mildly.</p>

<p>The conversation was interupted here by Shakespeare
Bobbet comin’ after Betsey, they had company.
Betsey returned with him, but her last words to me
was, in a low awful voice,</p>

<p>“Will you stand by me Josiah Allen’s wife?” I
sithed, and told her in a kind of a bland way, “I
would see about it.”</p>

<p>The donatin and fare occured Wednesday night,
and Josiah and me went early, Thomas J. and Tirzah
Ann bein’ off to school. And I carried as much and
as good as anybody there, though I say it that
shouldn’t. I carried as good vittles too as there was
and I didn’t scrimp in quantity neither.</p>

<p>We was a layin’ out to carry ’em half a barrel of
pork, and I made a big jar of butter and sold it, and
got the money for it, five dollars, and I atted Josiah
to sell the pork and get the money for that. Says I,
“Brother Minkley and his wife have both come to
years of understandin’, and it stands to reason that
they both know what they want better than we do,
and money will buy anything.”</p>

<p>Josiah kinder hung back, but I carried the day.
And so we carried 15 dollars in a envelop, and told
sister Minkley to open it after we got home. I didn’t
want ’em to thank us for it&mdash;it makes me feel just as
mean as pusley. But some folks carried the litlest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
things. There was a family of 7 hearty men and women,
and all they carried was a book mark out of perforated
paper, and a plate of cookeys. There was 7
book marks, for I counted ’em, and 14 pair of slips for
the minister’s only boy, who is home from school. And
this same young man, Whitfield Minkley, had 24 neck
ties. Of course there was some other things, a few
sassige or so, a little flour, and some dried blackberrys.</p>

<p>But it does beat all what simple things some folks
will carry. Shakespeare Bobbet carried the minister
a pair of spurs. Thinks I to myself, “What is he
goin’ to use ’em on, the saw horse or the front gate?”
For they have kep’ him doun so low, that he is too
poor to own any other steeds.</p>

<p>And Betsey Bobbet brought him a poem of hers all
flowered off round the edges, and trimmed with pink
ribbon. I haint nothin’ aginst poetry, but with a big
family like Brother Minkley’s, it did seem to me that
there was other things that would be more nourishin’
and go further.</p>

<p>After we had left our vittles in the procession
room where we was goin’ to eat, I marched into the
meetin’ house room which was full of folks, and Brother
Minkley came up to talk with me. I felt low spirited,
for Betsey’s design wore on me. And when
Brother Minkley took my hand in his’en, and shook it
in the purest and most innocent manner, and said,
“Sister Allen, what is the matter? are you havin’ a
xercise in your mind?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Says I to him, “Yes, Brother Minkley, I be.”</p>

<p>I turned the subject quickly then, for I abhor hippocrites,
and I felt that I was a deceivin’ him. For
whereas he thought I was havin’ a religous xcercise
performin’ in my mind, I was not; it was Betsey Bobbet’s
design that was a wearin’ on me. So I waved
off the subject quickly, though I knew that like as not
he would think I was a backslidin’ and was afraid he
would ketch me at it. Thinks’es I, better let him
think I am a slidin’ back, I can endure false importations
better than I can let myself out for a hyppocrite.
I waved off the subject and says I,</p>

<p>“That was a beautiful sermon of yours last Sunday,
Brother Minkley.”</p>

<p>“You mean that from the text ‘He overthrew the
tables of the money changers,’ and so forth; I am glad
it pleased you, sister Allen. I meant to hit a blow at
gamblin’ that would stagger it, for gamblin’ is a prevailin’
to a alarmin’ extent.” And then says he, plantin’
himself firmly before me, “Did you notice, sister
Allen, the lucid and logical manner in which I carried
up the argument from the firstly to the twenty-thirdly?”</p>

<p>I see then I was in for it. Brother Wesley Minkley
haint got another fault on earth as I know on&mdash;only
jest a catchin’ his church members and preachin’ his
sermons over to ’em. But I have said 100 times that
I am glad he has got that, for it sets me more at rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
about him on windy days. Not that I really s’pose he
will ascend, but if he hadn’t got that fault I should be
almost tempted to examine his shoulder blades occasionally,
(on the outside of his coat,) to see if his wings
was a spoutin’, he is so fine and honest and unsuspiceious.</p>

<p>When his sermons are so long that they get up into
the twentiethlies, and thirtiethlies, as they jinerally
do, I can’t say but what it is a little wearin’ on you, to
stand stun still whenever he happens to catch you, in
the store, or street, or doorstep, and have him preach
’em all over to you alone. You feel kinder curious,
and then sometimes your feet will get to sleep. But
on the present occasion I rejoiced, for it freed me for
the time bein’ from Betsey’s design. He laid holt of
that sermon, and carried it all up before me through
the firstlys and the tenthlys, just as neat and regular
as you could hist a barel up the chamber stairs, and
had just landed it before the ninteenthly which was,
“That all church members had ort to get together,
and rastle with the awful vice of gamblin’ and throw
it, and tread onto it,” when Betsey Bobbet appeared
before us suddenly with a big bag before her and
says she,</p>

<p>“Here is the grab bag, you must grab.”</p>

<p>I never heard of the thing before, and it come so
kind of sudden on me that I hung back at first.
But there wus a whole lot of folks lookin’ on, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
didn’t want to act odd, so I laid holt of it, and grabbed
it with both hands as tight as I could towards the
bottom. Betsey said that wasn’t the way, and then
her design so goaded her, that she bent forward and
whispered in my ear,</p>

<p>“The Editah of the Augah got home to-night, he
is expected here in half an hour, I expect you to stand
by me Josiah Allen’s wife.”</p>

<p>I sithed heavy, and while I was a sithin’ Betsey
asked Elder Minkley to grab, and he, thinkin’ no hurt,
bein’ so pure minded and unsuspicious, and of such a
friendly turn, he threw both arms around the bag
grabbed it, and held it tight. And then Betsey
explained it to us&mdash;you had to pay 25 cents and then
you run your hand into the bag, and had jest what
you happened to grab first.</p>

<p class="caption">THE ENEMY ATTACKTED.</p>
</div>

<p>Then at that minute I see the power of pure and cast
iron principle as I never seen it before. Betsey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Bobbet and all other sorrows and sufferin’ was for the
minute forgot, and I was glad I had been born. With
the look of a war horse when his mane tosses and
he snorts, a smellin’ of the battle field, Elder Wesley
Minkley ketched the bag out of Betsey’s tremblin’
hand, threw it down onto the floor, and sot down on
it. He looked peaceful then, he knew he had throwed
the tempter, and got on to it, holdin’ of it down.
In the most tryin’ and excitin’ scenes of life, the good
of the human race is my theme of mind, I am so
wrapped up in it, and then, even in this glorious scene,
I said to myself, “Ah would that Adam had served
them apples in the same way.”</p>

<p>Brother Minkley took out his red silk handkerchief
and wiped his heroic, but sweaty face, for it was warm
in the meetin’ house, and he bein’ a large portly man,
principle had heat him up. And then such a sermon
as he preached to Betsey Bobbet, it did my very soul
good to hear, says he, “It is gamblin’, and gamblin’
of the very worst kind to, for it is gamblin’ in the
name of God.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” says Betsey, “deah and respected sir, the
money is for you, and it is not gamblin’, for there is
not any wicked papeh cards connected with it at all,
it is only a sort of pious raffling in harmless pincushions
and innocent rag children.”</p>

<p>Then did I see pure principle mountin’ up higher
and higher, his honest fat face grew fire red with it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and says be, “No raffled pincushions shall ever enrich
me, I scorn lucre that is obtained in that way. Not
one cent of money Betsey Bobbet will I ever take,
that is realized from the sale of these ragged children.
Not a ragged child shall be gambled for, for me, not a
child.”</p>

<p>We was right under the gallery, and at this minute
a fish hook was let down not but a little ways from
us, and Shakespeare Bobbet who stood by a basket
full of things, hitched on a long huzzy all made of
different kinds of calico, and it went up a danglin’
over our heads. As he ketched sight of it, Brother
Wesley Minkley started up and says he, to Betsey in
tones that <em>would</em> be replied to,</p>

<p>“What does that mean?”</p>

<p>Says Betsey in almost tremblin’ tones, “They pay
ten cents for fishin’ once.”</p>

<p>Then says he in tones that sounded some like
distant thunder,</p>

<p>“Do they know what they are goin’ to get for thier
money?”</p>

<p>“No sir,” says she, and she quailed to that extent
that I almost pitied her.</p>

<p>“More gamblin’!” he cried in fearful tones. And
then he sprung for the huzzy, and shouted up the gallery
to Shakespeare Bobbet, “I forbid you to draw up
this huzzy another step. I forbid this huzzy to be
drawed up an inch further.” He hung on to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
huzzy with both hands, and says he&mdash;with the fire of
his old foregrandfather in his eye (who was an orderly
sargant in the Revolution) “I’ll see if there is goin’
to be huzzies gambled for in this way. I’ll see if
there is goin’ to be such shameless doin’s in my
church!”</p>

<p class="caption">THE ELDER ON THE ALERT.</p>
</div>

<p>For the next half hour confusion rained. But pure
principle conquered. In the language of scripture
slightly altered to suit the occasion, “He overthrew
the grab bags, and drove out the huzzies and fish
hooks.” When peace rained agin, I grasped holt of
his hand, and says I almost warmly,</p>

<p>“You have done a good job brother, some folks may
call it pious gamblin’, but I never believed in it.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Whitfield Minkley come up at that very minute, and
says he, “That is jest as I think,” says he, in the language
of Shakespeare, “‘It is stealin’ the livery horses
of heaven, to carry the devil out a ridin’” or mebby I
hain’t got the very words, but it was somethin’ to that
effect.</p>

<p>Says I, “I never knew that Shakespeare Bobbet ever
turned his mind that way,” and then says I in a cordial
way, “I am real glad you have got home Whitfield,
I guess I am about as glad to see you as any
body, unless it is your ma, and one or two others.”</p>

<p>He thanked me and said it seemed good to get home
agin, and then says he, “I suppose Tirzah Ann is
well.” His face as he said this was as red as his neck
tie. But I didn’t seem to notice it. I talked with
him quite a spell about her, and told him both the
children would be to home Saturday, and he must
come up then, for Thomas Jefferson would be awful
disappointed not to see him.</p>

<p>He looked awful tickled when I asked him to come,
and he said he should certainly come, for he never
wanted to see Thomas Jefferson so bad, in his life.</p>

<p>I don’t make no matches, nor break none. But I
hain’t a goin’ to deny, that sister Minkley and I have
talked it over, and if things go on, as they seem to be
a goin’ between <em>her</em> Whitfield and <em>our</em> Tirzah Ann,
there won’t be no straws laid in their way, not a
straw.</p>

<p>Whitfield was called off by one of his sisters, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Brother Wesley Minkley standin’ in front of me
begun,</p>

<p>“Sister Allen, I am very much like you, I believe
in actin’ up to our professions, and as I was about to
remark in my twentiethly,” then that good, pure
minded man begun agin jest where he left off. He
had jest lifted up his left hand, and was pintin’ it off
with his right fore finger, and I was jest thinkin’ that
most likely I had got my night’s job in front of me,
when unxpected the Editer of the Augur come to
speak to me, and Brother Wesley Minkley bein’ a true
gentleman, stopped preachin’ to once, and went to
talkin’ to Josiah.</p>

<p>I looked sadly into the face of the Editer of the
Augur, and sithed, for I knew that Betsey would soon
begin to encourage him, and I pitied him.</p>

<p>He said “How de do?” to me, and I said in a absent
minded way that “I was; and I hoped it was so
with him.” And then I sithed agin. And my two
gray eyes looked sadly into his’en (which was but’nut
colored) for a spell, and then roamed off across the
room onto Betsey. I seen her a fixin’ on her waterfall
more securely, and a shakin’ out her greek bender,
and tightnin’ her horse hair bracelets, and her lips
moved as if she was beginnin’ to prey. And I knew
he had got to be encouraged, and I felt for him.</p>

<p>The Editer of the Auger followed my mournful
gaze, and I was surprised to see the change in his but’nut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
eye as it met hers, from what it had been in more
former times preceedin’. For whereas he had always
looked at her with fear and almost agonizin’ aprehension,
as if he realized his danger, now he looked full
in her face, as she smiled across the room at him, with
a proud haughty and triumphant mene on him I could
not understand. He gazed at her silently for I should
think pretty near a half a minute and then he turned
to me with a sweet, contented smile curvin’ his moustache&mdash;which
had been colored a new bright black,&mdash;and
says he to me with a peaceful and serene look on
to Betsey,</p>

<p>“How sweet it is Josiah Allen’s wife for a noble but
storm tosted bark to anchor in a beautiful calm. How
sweet it is, when you see the ravenin’ tempest a smilin’
at you, I mean a lowerin’ at you, in the distance,
to feel that it can’t harm you&mdash;that you are beyond its
reach. To see it in its former dread power a drawin’
near&mdash;” (Betsey had started to come towards us,)
“and feel that you are safe from it. Josiah Allen’s
wife I feel safe and happy to night.”</p>

<p>Betsey was stopped for the minute by Deacon Gowdey,
but I knew it was only a momentary respite, and
knowin’ her design, how could I answer? I could
only look gloomy into his face, and think sadly, Ah!
how little we know when trials and dangers are ahead
of us, how little we know when we are goin’ to be
encouraged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>But he continued on in the same sweet happy triumphin’
tones,</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen’s wife, I believe you are my friend.”</p>

<p>“Yes! and your well wisher,” and says I almost
wildly, “whatever comes, whatever may happen to you,
remember that I wished you well, and I pitied you.”</p>

<p>“Instead of pityin’ me, wish me joy,” and he held
out his right hand towards me.</p>

<p>I haint no hypocrite, and knowin’ what I knew,
how could I be so deceitful? I hung back and gripped
holt of a breadth of my dress with my right hand.</p>

<p>Says he, “I am married, Josiah Allen’s wife, I was
married a week ago to-night.”</p>

<p>I grasped holt of his right hand which he still held
out, with my right hand, and says I, “you take a load
off’en my mind. Who too?”</p>

<p>Says he, “the prettiest girl in Log London where
father lives.”</p>

<p>My emotions paralyzed me for nearly a quarter of a
minute, and then says I,</p>

<p>“Where is she?”</p>

<p>“To her folks’es,” says he, “But she will be here
next week.”</p>

<p>Betsey drew near. He looked calmly and fearlessly
at her, but he murmured gently, “The twins will be
a wakin’ up; I must be a goin’,” and he gently
retreated.</p>

<p>The first words Betsey said to me was, “Ketch hold
of me Josiah Allen’s wife, ketch hold of me, I am on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the very point of swooning.”</p>

<p>Then I knew what Deacon Gowdey had been a tellin’
her. She looked like a blue ghost, trimmed off
with otter color, for she had on a blue parmetta dress
all trimmed with annato colored trimmin’s. She murmured
in almost incoherent words, somethin’ about “her
dearest gazelle bein’ a dyin’, and her wantin’ to be
took off to her buryin’ ground.” But I knew it was
no time for me to show my pity; true friendship
demanded firmness and even sternness, and when she
asked me wildly agin to “ketch hold of her,” I says
to her coldly,</p>

<p>“Ketch holt of yourself, Betsey Bobbet.”</p>

<p>“My lost, my dearest gazelle is a dyin’! my hopes
are witherin’!” says she, shettin’ up her eyes and
kinder staggerin’ up against the wall.</p>

<p>Says I in tones as cold as old Zero, or pretty nigh as
cold as that old man,</p>

<p>“Let ’em wither.”</p>

<p>But I see I must come out still more plainer, or she
would make a public circus of herself, and says I
pushin’ her into a corner, and standin’ up in front of
her, so as to shet off the audience from her face, for
she was a cryin’, and she did indeed look ghostly,</p>

<p>“Betsey Bobbet the gazelle is married, and their
hain’t no use in your follerin’ on that trail no longer.
Now,” says I, “take your bunnet and go home,
and collect yourself together. And,” says I, generously
“I will go with you as far as the door.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>So I got her started off, as quick, and as quiet as I
could, and I guess there wasn’t mor’n seven men and
14 wimmen that asked me as I came back in,</p>

<p>“If it was the Editer of the Augur, that Betsey
was a cryin’ about, and if I ever see such a idiot in
my life?”</p>

<p>I answered ’em in a kind of blind way, and it
broke up pretty soon.</p>

<p>When Josiah and me went home, as we passed Mr.
Bobbet’ses, I looked up into Betsey’s winder which
fronted the road, and I see Betsey set by her table a
writin’. Her lips were firmly closed and she was a
cryin’, her cheeks looked holler and I knew that her
teeth was out, so I felt that she was writin’ poetry.
I was right, for in the next weeks <cite>Gimlet</cite> these verses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
came out. These lines was wrote on to the top of
’em:</p>

<p>“We do not wish to encourage the feeling of revenge
in our fair contributor’s fair breast, but this we will
say, that on some occasions, revenge is a noble feeling
and almost leans over against virtue’s side. And
though we do not wish to be personal&mdash;no one could
scorn it more than we do&mdash;but we say, and we say it
with the kindest feelings towards him, that the E&mdash;&mdash;
of the A&mdash;&mdash; is a <em>villian</em>.”</p>

<h2 id="WIMMENS_SPEAH">WIMMEN’S SPEAH.</h2>

<p>One bright, beautiful day, I had got my mornin’s
work all done up, and had sot doun to double some
carpet yarn, and Josiah sot behind the stove, blackin’
his boots, when Betsey come in for a mornin’s call.
She hadn’t sot but a few minutes when says she,</p>

<p>“I saw you was not doun to the lecture night before
last, Josiah Allen’s wife. I was sorry that I attended
to it, but my uncle’s people where I was visitin’ went,
and so I went with them. But I did not like it, I do
not believe in wimmin’s havin’ any rights. I think it
is real bold and unwomanly in her to want any rights.
I think it is not her speah, as I remarked last night
to our deah New Preacher. As we was a coming out,
afteh the lecture, the fringe of my shawl ketched on
to one of the buttons of his vest, and he could not get
it off&mdash;and I did not try to, I thought it was not my
place&mdash;so we was obleeged to walk close togatheh,
cleah through the hall, and as I said to him, afteh I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
had enquired if he did not find it very lonesome here,
says I, ‘It is not wimmin’s speah to vote,’ and says I,
‘do you not think it is woman’s nature naturally to be
clingin’?’ ‘I <em>do</em>,’ says he, ‘Heaven <em>knows</em> I <em>do</em>.’ And
he leaned back with such a expression of stern despaih
on to his classic features, that I knew he felt it strongly.
And I said the truth. I do not believe wimmin
ought to vote.”</p>

<p>“Nor I nuther,” says Josiah, “she haint got the
rekrisite strength to vote, she is too fraguile.”</p>

<p>Jest at this minute the boy that draws the milk came
along, and Josiah, says he to me, “I am in my stockin’
feet, Samantha, can’t you jest step out and help Thomas
Jefferson on with the can?”</p>

<p>Says I, “If I am too fraguile to handle a paper vote,
Josiah Allen, I am too fraguile to lift 100 and 50
pounds of milk.”</p>

<p>He didn’t say nothin’, but he slipped on his rubbers
and started out, and Betsey resumed, “It is so revoltin’
to female delicacy to go to the poles and vote;
most all of the female ladies that revolve around in
the high circles of Jonesville aristocracy agree with
me in thinkin’ it is real revoltin’ to female delicacy to
vote.”</p>

<p class="caption">FEMALE DELICACY</p>
</div>

<p>“Female delicacy!” says I, in a austeer tone. “Is
female delicacy a plant that withers in the shadder of
the pole, but flourishes in every other condition only
in the shadder of the pole?” says I in a tone of witherin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
scorn. “Female delicacy flourishes in a ball
room, where these sensitive creeters with dresses on
indecently low in the neck, will waltz all night with
strange men’s arms round their waists,” says I. “You
have as good as throwed it in my face, Betsey Bobbet,
that I haint a modest woman, or I would be afraid to
go and vote; but you ketch me with a low neck dress
on, Betsey Bobbet, and you will ketch me on my way
to the Asylum, and there haint a old deacon, or minister,
or presidin’ Elder in the Methodist church, that
could get me to waltz with ’em, let alone waltzin’ with
promiscuus sinners. And,” says I in the deep, calm
tone of settled principle, “if you don’t believe it, bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
on your old deacons and ministers, and presidin’ Elders,
and try me.”</p>

<p>“You are gettin’ excited, Samantha,” says Josiah.</p>

<p>“You jest keep blackin’ your boots, Josiah Allen,
I haint a talkin’ to you. Betsey, is it any worse for a
female woman to dress herself in a modest and Christian
manner, with a braige viel over her face, and a
brass mounted parasol in her hand, and walk decently
to the pole and lay her vote on it, than to be introduced
to a man, who for all you know may be a retired pirate,
and have him walk up and hug you by the hour,
to the music of a fiddle and a base violin?”</p>

<p>“But if you vote you have got to go before a board
of men, and how tryin’ to delicacy that would be.”</p>

<p>“I went before a board of men when I joined the
meetin’ house, and when I got the premium for my
rag carpet, and I still live and call myself a respectable
character, but,” says I in a vain of unconcealed sarcasm
“if these delicate ball characters are too modest to go
in broad daylight armed with a umbrell before a venerable
man settin’ on a board, let ’em have a good old
female board to take thier votes.”</p>

<p>“Would it be lawful to have a female board?” says
Betsey.</p>

<p>“Wimmen can be boards at charity schools&mdash;poor
little paupers, pretty hard boards they find ’em some
times&mdash;and they can be boards at fairs, and hospitals,
and penitentarys, and picnics, and African missions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and would it be any worse to be a board before these
delicate wimmen,” says I, almost carried away with
enthusiasm, “I would be a board myself.”</p>

<p class="caption">NO TIME TO VOTE.</p>
</div>

<p>“Yes you would make a pretty board,” says Josiah,
“you would make quite a pile of lumber.” I paid no
attention to his sarkastic remark, and Betsey went on.</p>

<p>“It would be such public business Josiah Allen’s
wife for a woman to recieve votes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as it would be any more public business,
than to sell Episcopal pin cushiens, Methodist
I scream, or Baptist water melons, by the hour to a
permiscuus crowd.”</p>

<p>But says Betsey, “’twould
devouh too much of a female’s
time, she would
not have time to vote,
and perform the other
duties that are incumbient
upon her.”</p>

<img src="images/illus35.jpg" width="375" height="375" alt="" />
<p class="caption">DREADFUL SHORT OF TIME.</p>
</div>

<p>Says I, “Wimmen find
time for thier everlastin’
tattin’ and croshain’.
They find plenty of time
for thier mats, and their
tidys, their flirtations,
thier feather flowers, and bead flowers, and hair flowers,
and burr flowers, and oriental paintin’s, and Grecian
paintin’s, and face paintin’s. They spend more
time a frizzin’ thier front hair than they would, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
learn the whole constitution by heart; and if they get
a new dress they find plenty of time to cut it all up
into strips, jest to pucker it up and set it on agin.
They can dress up in thier best and patrol the streets
as regular as a watchman, and lean over the counter
in dry good stores till they know every nail in ’em by
heart. They find plenty of time for all this, and to
go to all the parties they can hear of, and theatres and
conserts, and shows of all kinds, and to flirt with every
man they can lay holt of, and to cover their faces
with their fans and giggle; but when it comes to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
act as simple and short as puttin’ a letter into the post
office, they are dreadful short on it for time.”</p>

<p>But says Betsey, “The study that would be inevitable
on a female in ordeh to make her vote intelligably,
would it not be too wearing on her?”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;" id="illus36">
<img src="images/illus36.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">NO TIME TO STUDY LAWS.</p>
</div>

<p>“No! not a single bit; s’posin these soft, fashionable
wimmen should read a little about the nation she lives
in, and the laws that protects her if she keeps ’em, and
hangs and imprisons her if she breaks ’em? I don’t
know but it would be as good for her, as to pore over
novels all day long,” says I; “these very wimmen that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
think the President’s bureau is a chest of draws where
he keeps his fine shirts, and the tariff is a wild horse
the senators keep to ride out on,&mdash;these very wimmen
that can’t find time to read the constitution, let ’em
get on to the track of a love-sick hero and a swoonin’
heroine, and they will wade through half a dozen volumes,
but what they will foller ’em clear to Finis to
see ’em married there,” says I, warmin’ with my subject,
“Let there be a young woman hid in a certain
hole, guarded by 100 and 10 pirates, and a young
man tryin’ to get to her, though at present layin’
heavily chained in a underground dungeon with his
rival settin’ on his back, what does a woman care
for time or treasure, till she sees the pirates all killed
off with one double revolver, and the young woman
lifted out swoonin’ but happy, by the brave hero?”
Says I, in a deep camp meetin’ voice, “If there had
been a woman hid on the Island of Patmos, and Paul’s
letters to the churches had been love letters to her,
there wouldn’t be such a thick coat of dust on bibles
as there is now.</p>

<p>“But if wimmen <em>don’t</em> read about the laws they’ll
know as much as some other folks do. I have
seen men voters,” says I, and I cast a stern glance
onto Josiah as I spoke, “whose study into national
affairs didn’t wear on ’em enough to kill ’em at
all. I have seen voters,” says I with another cuttin’
look at him, “that didn’t know as much as their wives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
did.” Josiah quailed a very little as I said this, and I
continued on&mdash;“I have seen Irish voters, whose intellects
wasn’t tiresome to carry round, and whose knowledge
concernin’ public affairs wasn’t so good as it
was about rum, and who would sell their votes for a
drink of whiskey, and keep it up all day, votin’ and
drinkin’ and then drinkin’ and votin’, and I guess
wimmen won’t do any worse.”</p>

<p>Betsey almost quailed before my lofty glance and
voice, but continued on cleavin’ to the subject&mdash;“How
awful and revolting it would sound to hear
the faih and softeh sex talking about tariffs and caurkusses.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” says I, “but I had as lives hear
’em talk about caurkusses, as to hear ’em backbitin’
thier neighbors and tearin’ the charicters of other wimmen
into bits, or talkin’ about such little things as
wimmen will; why in a small place, a woman can’t
buy a calico apron without the neighborhood holdin’ a
inquest over it. Some think she ort to have it, some
think it is extravagant in her, and some think the set
flower on it is too young for her, and then they will
all quarrel agin whether she ort to make it with a bib
or not.” Says I “the very reason why men’s talk as
a general thing is nobler than wimmen’s, is because
they have nobler things to think about.” Says I “Betsey
Bobbet, when did you ever know a passel of men
to set down and spend a whole afternoon talkin’ about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
each other’s vest, and mistrustin’ such a feller painted;
fill a woman’s mind with big, noble sized thoughts,
and she won’t talk such little back bitin’ gossip as she
does now.”</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen’s wife,” says Betsey, “I shall always
say it is not woman’s speah to vote.”</p>

<p>“No,” says Josiah, “it hain’t; wimmen would vote
for the handsomest men, and the men that praised thier
babys, they wouldn’t stand up onto principal as men
do, and then, how they would clog up the road ’lection
day, tryin’ to get all the news they could, wimmen
have got such itchin’ ears.”</p>

<p>“Itchin’ ears!” says I, “principle!” says I, in low
but awful deep tones of voice, “Josiah Allen, it seems
to me, that I wouldn’t try to stand up onto principle
agin, till the pantaloons are wore out you hired a man
with to vote your ticket.” He begun to look sheepish
at once, and I continued in still more awful accents,
“talk about itchin’ ears, Josiah Allen! here you have
sot all the mornin’ blackin’ your boots, you have rubbed
them boots till you have most rubbed holes
through ’em, jest for an excuse to set here and hear
me and Betsey Bobbet talk. And it hain’t the first
time nuther, for I have known you Josiah Allen, when
I have had female visitors, to leave your work and
come in and lay on that lounge behind the stove till
you was most sweltered, pretendin’ you was readin’.”</p>

<p>“I <em>wuz</em> a readin’,” says Josiah drawin’ on his boots.</p>

<p>“I have ketched you laughin’ over a funeral sermon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
and a President’s message, what is there highlarious
in a funeral sermon Josiah Allen? What is
there exhileratin’ in a President’s message?”</p>

<p>“Wall,” says he, “I guess I’ll water the steers.”</p>

<p>“I should think you had better,” says I coolly, and
after he went out, Betsey resumed,</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen’s wife, I still say it is not woman’s
speah to vote,” and she continued, “I have got a few
verses in my pocket, which I composed that night
aftah I returned from the lecture, which embody into
them the feelings of my soul concerning woman’s
speah. I went to my chamber, and let down my back
haih, and took out my teeth, I always feel more free
somehow, and poetic, with my hair down and my
teeth out, and there I wrote these stanzeys, and seeing
it is you, I will read them to you.”</p>

<p>My firm and cast iron principles forbid my wishin’
in a reckless way that I wasn’t myself, and I was in
my own house, and horspitality forbid my orderin’ her
in stern accents, not to read a word of ’em, so I submitted,
and she read as follows:</p>

<p class="caption">A WOMAN’S RIGHTS.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have seen wimmen that was willin’ to marry,
but the men wasn’t forthcomin’, what are they to do?
What are the wimmen to do whose faces are as humbly
as a plate of cold greens?” Says I, in stern tones,
“Are men to be pursued like stricken dears by a mad
mob of humbly wimmen? Is a woman to go out into
the street and collar a man and order him to marry
her? I am sick of this talk about its bein’ a woman’s
only speah to marry. If it is a woman’s only speah
to marry, the Lord will provide her with a <em>man</em>, it
stands to reason he will. One that will suit her too,
one that will come jest as nateral for her to leave all
of the rest of the world and foller, as for a sunflower
to foller on after the sun. One that she seems to
belong to, jest like North and South America, joined
by nature unbeknown to them ever sense creation.
She’ll know him if she ever sees him, for their two
hearts will suit each other jest like the two halves of
a pair of shears. These are the marriages that Heaven
signs the certificates of, and this marryin’ for a home,
or for fear of bein’ called a old maid, is no more marriage
in the sight of God, no more true marriage,
than the blush of a fashionable woman that is bought
for ten cents an ounce and carried home in her pocket,
is true modesty.”</p>

<p>Here was a pause, durin’ which Betsey quailed
some, and I then resumed again, in the same lofty
tones and I don’t know but a little loftier, “There is
but one thing that makes marriage pure and holy in
the sight of God.”</p>

<p>“And what is that?” says Betsey in an enquirin’
tone.</p>

<p>“Love,” says I, in a full clear tone, “Love, such as
angels feel for one another, love, such as Samantha
Smith felt for Josiah Allen, though <em>why</em> I loved him,
Heaven knows, I don’t. But I couldn’t help it, and
I would have lived single till them days we read of,
if I hadn’t. Though for what reason I loved him&mdash;” I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
continued mewsin’ly, and almost lost in deep retrospectin’,&mdash;“I
don’t know. I don’t believe in rehearsin’
privacies and braggin’ about such things, but in the
name of principle I speak. A richer man wanted me
at the same time, a man that knew half as much
agin, at least, as Josiah. I no need to have wet the
ends of my fingers in dishwater if I had married the
other one, but I couldn’t do it, I loved Josiah, <em>though
why</em>”&mdash;and agin I plunged down into deep abstraction
as I murmured to myself,&mdash;“though <em>why</em> I did, I don’t
know.”</p>

<p>“In them days,” says I, risin’ up agin out of my
revery, “In them days to come, when men and wimmen
are independent of each other, marriage will be
what it ought to be, for folks won’t marry unless God
unites their hearts so close they can’t get ’em apart
nohow. They won’t be tackled together by any old
rotton ropes of interest and accomidation, that are
liable to break in to pieces any minute, and in them
days, the hands of divorce writers won’t be so lame as
they be now.”</p>

<p>“I cannot comprehend,” says Betsey “how wimmen’s
votin’, will change the reprehensible ideah of marryin’
for a home, or for fear of being ridiculed about, if it
will, I cannot see.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you see daylight Betsey Bobbet, when the
sun is mountin’ up into the clear horizeon?” Says I
in a eloquent voice, “it stands to reason that a woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
won’t marry a man she don’t love, for a home, if she is
capable of makin’ one for herself. Where’s the disgrace
of bein’ a old maid, only wimmen are kinder dependent
on men, kinder waitin’ to have him ask her
to marry him, so as to be supported by him? Give a
woman as many fields to work in as men have, and as
good wages, and let it be thought jest as respectable
for ’em to earn <em>thier</em> livin’ as for a man to, and that
is enough. It riles me to hear ’em talk about wimmen’s
wantin’ to wear the breeches; they don’t want
to; they like calico better than broadcloth for stiddy
wear, they like muslin better than kersey mear for
handsome, and they have a nateral hankerin’ after the
good opinion and admiration of the other sect, but they
can do better without that admiration than they can
without vittles.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says Betsey “men do admire to have wimmen
clingin’ to ’em, like a vine to a stately tree, and it
is indeed a sweet view.”</p>

<p>“So ’tis, so ’tis,” says I, “I never was much of a clinger
myself. Still if females want to cling, I haint no
objection. But,” says I, in reasonable tones, “as I
have said more’n a hundred times, if men think that
wimmen are obleeged to be vines, they ought to feel
obleeged to make trees of themselves, for ’em to run
up on. But they won’t; some of ’em, they will not be
trees, they seem to be sot against it. And as I have
said what if a vine haint no tree convenient to cling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
to? or if she has, what if the tree she clings to happens
to fall through inherient rotteness at the core,
thunder and lightnin’ or etcetery? If the string breaks
what is to become of the creeper if it can’t do nothin’ but
creep? Says I, “it is all well enough for a rich woman
to set in a velvet gown with her feet on the warm
hearth and wonder what makes the poor drunkard’s
wife down in the street, shiver. Let her be out once
with her bare feet in the snow, and she’d find out. It
haint the rich, happy, comfortable clingers I am talkin’
in behalf of, but the poor shiverers outside who
haint nothin’ to cling to.”</p>

<p>“Women’s speah”&mdash;began Betsey.</p>

<p>“Women’s speah,” says I interuptin’ her in a
magestic tone before which Betsey quailed imperceptably.
“Women’s speah is where she can do the
most good; if God had meant that wimmen should be
nothin’ but men’s shadders, He would have made
gosts and fantoms of ’em at once. But havin’ made
’em flesh and blood, with braens and souls, I believe
He meant ’em to be used to the best advantage.
And the talk about wimmen havin’ to fight, and men
wash dishes, if wimmen vote, is all shear nonsense. In
the Baptist church where wimmen vote, I don’t see as
they act different from other wimmen, and I don’t
see as the Baptist men act any more sheepish than
common men.” Says I “it is jest as ridiculous to
say it would make a woman act coarse and rampage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
round to vote, as to say that kissin’ a pretty baby, or
lovin’ books and music and pictures, makes a man a
hen huzzy.”</p>

<p>Says I, carried away with powerful emotions, “you
may shet a lion up for years, in a room full of cambric
needles and tattin shettles, and you can’t get him to do
anything but roar at ’em, it haint a lion’s nature to do
fine sewin’,” says I. “And you may tie up a old hen
as long as you please, and you can’t break her of
wantin’ to make a nest, and scratch for her chickens.”
Says I&mdash;wavin’ my right hand, slow and magestically&mdash;“you
may want a green shade onto the front side of
your house, and to that end and effect you may plant
a acorn, and set out a rose bush, but all the legeslaters
in creation can’t make that acorn tree blow out with
red posys, no more can they make that rose bush
stand up straight as a giant. And thier bein’ planted
by the side of each other&mdash;on the same ground and
watered out of the same waterin’ jug&mdash;don’t olter
thier natural turn. <em>They will both help shade the
winder</em>, but do it in their own way which is different.
And men and wimmen votin’ side by side,
would no more alter their natural dispositions than
singin’ one of Watts’es hymns together would. One
will sing base, and the other air, so long as the world
stands.”</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen’s wife,” says Betsey, “I think your
views are uronieus. We cannot think alike about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
clinging, we also diffeh in our views about caurkusses.
When I consideh that ’lections and caurkusses come
once every yeah, then comes home the solemn feelin’,
how wearin’ it would be for a female to drop all
her domestic labohs and avocations, and be present at
them. Josiah Allen’s wife, let us sposen’ the case,
sposen’ a women is a washin’, or churnin’ buttah,
how could she leave this laboh to go and vote?” I
was so wore out, that says I, “we <em>will</em> sposen’ the
case, sposen’ a women is a fool, how can she talk common
sense?” Says I, with so impatient a gesture that I
broke off a thread, and had to tie it on agin “you are
goin’ over the same old ground agin of a woman’s
time,” says I “wimmen can drop all thier domestic
labors and go to fares&mdash;town fares, and county fares,
and state fares if she can get to ’em. She will be on
the ground in time to see the first punkin and bedquilt
carried on to it, and she will stay to see the last
horse, trot his last trot; she can find time for picnics
and pleasure exertions, and celebrations, and 4th of
July&mdash;that last, all day&mdash;and it would take about half a
minute to vote. But,” says I, in the most grand and
noble tone I had used yet. “Men haint took by the
coat collar and dragged off to caurkusses and ’lections,
they don’t go unless they are a mind to, and I don’t
suppose wimmen would be drove there like a flock of
sheep. They wouldn’t want to go; only, when some
great law was up concerning right and wrong, or her
own intrinsick interests, as givin a mother a equal
right to her children, a right she earnt naturally, a
deed God himself stamped with the great seals of fear
and agony. Or bein’ taxed without representation;
which breaks the old constitution right into, in the
middle, every time it is done. Or concernin’ equal
pay, for equal labor. I spose every female clerk and
teacher and operator, who have half starved on about
one third what men get for doin’ the same work
would be on hand. Like wise concerning Temperance,
I spose every drunkards wife and mother and
girl would go to the pole, that could get there. Poor
things, under the Legislator they have enjoyed the
right of sufferin’; sposen’ it lets ’em enjoy the right of
suffragin’ a spell, mebby they would find it as easy if
not easier.”</p>

<h2 id="A_TOWER_TO_NEW_YORK_DISCUSSED">A TOWER TO NEW YORK DISCUSSED.</h2>

<p>The summer after the Donation and Fare dawned
peacefully and fair on Jonesville and the earth. The
weather was pleasant, and things seemed to go on as
Sister Wesley Minkley and I could wish them to,
between her Whitfield, and our Tirzah Ann. Thomas
Jefferson every fortnight or so dressed up in his
best and went in the direction of Lawyer Snow’s.
He <em>said</em> that “he went to a new protracted meetin’
that they had jest started up that way.” I don’t say
that he didn’t, but I will say that they protracted ’em
pretty late. I don’t make no matches nor break none,
but I must say that things look promisin’ and agreable
in the direction of the children. Whitfield Minkley,
and Maggy Snow, is agreeable to me, <em>very</em>; so they
be to Josiah.</p>

<p>Josiah thinks considerable of Maggy’s bein’ so fore-handed.
I say <em>myself</em> if she hadn’t but one hand in
the line of riches, or no hand at all, she would still be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
<em>my</em> choice. She is a straight-forward sensible girl&mdash;with
no affectation, or sham about her. She reminds
me of what Samantha Allen was, before she had
changed her maiden name of Smith. Whether they
are really engaged or not, I don’t know, for Thomas
J. is such a hand for fun that you can’t find out anything
from him no more than you could from the
wind. But good land! there is time enough. The
children shan’t marry anybody in one good five years
from now, if I have my say about it. But as I told
Josiah, I remember we was a talkin’ it over last fall,
as we sot out a new orchard&mdash;I was a holdin’ the trees
for him and says I&mdash;“Josiah it is our duty to get
apple trees and children started in the right direction,
and then let them take their time to grow.”</p>

<p>He said, “Yes, so it was.”</p>

<p>He feels well about it, as I say, it is agreeable to us
both, and then Josiah’s crops looked well, the crows
took a little of his corn, but it had come on, and bid
fair to be a first rate crop. And as for his oats and
barley and winter wheat, they couldn’t be bettered.</p>

<p>The Editer of the Augur had brought home his
bride, a good lookin’ light complected woman, who
seemed devoted to him and the two twins. They
went to house keepin’ in a bran new house, and it
was observed that he bought a cottage bedstead
that didn’t have any posts, and life for him seemed
blest and peaceful.</p>

<p>Betsey Bobbet did not pine away and expire as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
might be expected by cursory readers of her last poem
in the Jonesville Gimlet. But any deep philosipher
who had made the Human Race, his (or her) study
for any length of time, never worrys over such
efushions, knowin’ that affliction is like the measles,
and if they break out freely in pimples and poetry,
the patients are doin’ well.</p>

<p>Betsey had been pretty quiet for her through the
winter and spring, she hadn’t made overtures only to
two more&mdash;which was a little pill doctor, and a locul
preacher who had been sent round by the Conference.
As she remarked to me, “It is so natural to get
attached to your minister and your physician.”</p>

<p>As I said the summer sun basked peacefully down
and Jonesville almost asleep under her rays, seemed
the abode of Repose. But where was there a Eden
fenced in, but what Ambition let down the bars, or
climbed over the fence. But this was a noble Ambition,
a Ambition I was proud to see a gettin’ over the
fence. It was a Ambition that leaped over into my
door yard the very day I heard the blessed tidings,
that Horace Greeley was run up for President.</p>

<p>I had always respected Horace, he had always been
dear to me. And when I say dear, I want it to be
plainly understood&mdash;I insist upon it that it <em>shall</em> be understood&mdash;that
I mean dear, in a scriptural, and political
sense. Never sense I united myself to Josiah Allen,
has my heart swerved from that man so much as
the breadth of a horse hair. But Horace’s honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
pure views of life, has endeared him to every true lover
of the Human Race, Josiah Allen’s wife included.
Of course we don’t think alike on every subject. No
2 human bein’s ever did. Horace and I differ on some
things such as biled vittles, Wimmen’s Rights, and
cream biscuit. He don’t believe in biled vittles, and
it is my favorite beverage. He is a unbeliever in salaratus,
I myself don’t see how he makes cream biscuit
fit to eat without it. And he&mdash;not havin’ me to influence
him&mdash;hadn’t come out on to the side of wimmen’s
havin’ a Right. But as a general thing, Horace Greeley
was to be found onto the side of Right. He was
onto the side of the weak, the down trodden. He was
always a plottin’ to do some good to somebody, and I
felt that if the eyes of his spectacles could be once opened
onto this subject of wimmen’s havin’ a Right, that
he would be more help to us, than a army of banners.
Months before he was run up for President I had felt
this, and in the fall of 1871, as Josiah was a settin’ by
the fire alone, he a readin’ the World and I a knittin’
says I to him,</p>

<p>“Josiah are you willin’ that I should go down to
New York village on a tower, and have a talk with
Horace about the Human race and wimmen’s havin’ a
right?”</p>

<p>Josiah didn’t seem to be willin’, he looked up from
the World, and muttered somethin’ about “Tammany’s
ring.”</p>

<p>I don’t know when the old Smith blood so riled up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
in me as it did then. I remember I riz right up
where I set in front of the stove, and waved my right
hand, I was so excited, and says I,</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen if you have lived with me goin on 15
years, and if you haint no more confidence in me than
to think I would accept a ring from old Tammany,
then I will stay to home.” Says I, “Josiah Allen, I never
mistrusted till this very minute that you had a
jealous hair in your head,” says I, “you have fell 35
cents in my estimation to night,” says I, “you know Josiah
Allen that I haint never wore no jewelrey sense
I jined the Methodist meetin’ house, and if I did, do
you spose I would accept a ring from old Tammany,
that sneakin’ old Democrat? I hate old Tammany, I
perfectly despise the old man.”</p>

<p>I felt so imposed upon and worked up, that I started
right off to bed and forgot to wind up the clock,
or shet the buttery door, for I remember the clock
run down and the cat eat the inside out of the
custard pies. Wall from that time I never had
opened my head to Josiah about goin’ off on a tower.
But I wrote Horace a letter on the subject of Wimmen’s
Rights, as good a letter as I knew how, beggin’
him to follow the example of J. Allen’s wife, and all
other noble reformers and put his shoulder blades to
the wheel.</p>

<p>His answer wasn’t so satisfactory as I could have
wished it was, and I knew I could do better to stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
face to face with him. But as I say I don’t know as I
should ever have started up agin, if that great and
good man hadn’t been run up for President.</p>

<p>Now some thought it looked shiftless in the Democrats,
and kinder poverty struck in ’em, to think
they had got all out of President stuff, and had to
borry some of the Republicans. But good land!
where is there a housekeeper but what will once in a
while get out of tea and have to borry a drawin’ of
her neighbors? If good honest, smart men was skurse
amongst ’em, if they had got kinder run out of President
timber, and wanted to borry a little, why it
would have looked dreedful tight and unneighberly
in the Republicans to have refused ’em, when they
was well on it too for President stuff, they could
have spared two or three jest as well as not, even if
they never got ’em paid back. But the Democrats
only wanted to borry one, and that was Horace.
The Democrats thought everything of Horace because
he put a bail onto Jeff. Davis. Josiah said at the
time that it raised him 25 cents or more in his estimation.
At the same time it madded some of the Republicans.
But it didn’t me. You see I believe jest
what I think is right, and pay no attention to what
the other folks who are standin’ on my doorstep may
happen to believe.</p>

<p>Nobody that stands on my platform&mdash;let ’em stand
as close to me as they are a mind to&mdash;not one of ’em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
is answerable to God for what thoughts and principles
are performin’ in my mind and soul. Josiah Allen’s
wife hangs on to nobody’s apron strings only jest her
own.</p>

<p>As far as the party on my doorstep believe what I
think is right, I am with ’em heart and hand, but I
am not one to shet up my eyes and walk up blindly
and hang on to anybody’s apron strings, not even
Horace Greeley’s, as anybody can see in the matter
of biled vittles, Wimmen’s Rights, and cream biscuit.
To think you have got to believe every thing your
party does, seems jest as unreasonable to me, as it
would when you go out to pick greens, to pick skunk
cabbage because cow cabbage is good and wholesome.
Why skunk cabbage is pison, jest as pison as sikuta
or ratsbane. Now the doctrine of free love as some
folks preach it up, folks in both parties, why the
smell of it is jest as obnoxious in my political and
moral nostrals as the smell of sikuta is, and if anything
smells worse than that, I don’t want to go near
it. Pick out the good and leave the bad, is my
theme in greens and politix.</p>

<p>Now about puttin’ that bail onto Jeff. Davis, though
as I say it madded my party, I was glad he put it on.
Jeff. was a mean critter no doubt, but I don’t know
as chokin’ him to death with a rope would have made
him any better. I say this idee of chokin’ folks
to death to reform ’em, is where we show the savage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
in us, which we have brought down from our barbarious
ancestors. We have left off the war paint and war
whoops, and we shall leave off the hangin’ when we
get civilized.</p>

<p>Says some to me, “Look at our poor Northern
boys that suffered and died in Libby prison and
Andersonville through Jefferson.”</p>

<p>I says to ’em, “Would chokin’ Jefferson bring ’em
back? if so I would choke him myself.&mdash;not to kill
him of course, but so he would feel it, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>No! it was all over, and past. All the sin, and
all the sorrow of the war. And God had out of it
brought a great good to the black Africans, and the
nation, in the way all good is generally brought,
through sufferin’ and tribulation. And if a nation
is made perfect through sufferin’ what should be the
first lesson she should show to the world?</p>

<p>I say, it should be the lesson that Christ and his
disciples taught, that of all Heavenly graces, charity
is the greatest. The way I looked at it was this.
The South that had been so braggin’, and selfish, and
overbearin’, stood at the door of the proud and victorious
North, like a beggar, harmless, destitute and
ragged. Where is the rich happy woman that
wouldn’t give a nut-cake to a sick beggar? I don’t
see myself how she could help givin’ one, if she had
any generosity and nobility and&mdash;nut-cakes.</p>

<p>Jeff. Davis was all broke to pieces, and he wanted a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
bail put onto him so life could grip holt of him agin,
and carry him I hope towards that heaven he turned
his back to, when he was a fightin’ to uphold slavery.
Horace helped put that bail on, and so did other noble
men; and all the ministers in creation, of every persuasion,
might all stand up in a row in our door yard,
and preach to me 2 days, and then I wouldn’t believe
that H. G. would turn his hand to anything he
thought was wrong.</p>

<p>If there was any fault in him about this, it was on
the side of charity and mercy, and as a general thing
that end of the board don’t tip up any too fur in this
selfish world. As a general thing, folks don’t teter on
that end of the board so much as they do on the other.</p>

<p>So, as I said, when I heard that Horace was run up
for President, I was so happy that my heart would
have sung for joy if it had been anything of a singer,
for now, thinks’es I, with that great and good and
honest man for President, all he wants is the influence
of Josiah Allen’s wife to make him all the sufferin’
nation needs. I felt that now the time had come for
J. Allen’s wife to come out boldly and put her shoulder
blades to the wheel. I felt that if Horace could
be perswaded to draw and Josiah Allen’s wife to push,
nothin’ could hender that wheel from movin’ right
onward into Freedom. And so my principles, and
the great doctrine so goared me, that I couldn’t get
no rest, I felt that I <em>must</em> see Horace before he got sot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
doun in the high chair, because you know when any
body gets sot doun they don’t love to nestle round and
make no changes. So I atted Josiah about it, but he
didn’t seem to be willin’. I didn’t come right out and
tell him how I was xcercised on Wimmin’s Rights,
knowin’ he was a unbeliever, but I says to him,</p>

<p>“Josiah, Jonesville is a good village, but nobody
wants to be tied doun even to a barell of sale molasses.
Josiah, I do want to see some other village, I do want
to go to New York on a tower.”</p>

<p>Says he, “Samantha, what under the sun do you
want to go for at your age, why do you want to start
up and go a caperin’ round the country?”</p>

<p>I thought a minute, and then says I, “I want to see
Miss Woodhull, and give her a real talkin’ to, about
free love. I want to convince her she is in the wrong
on it,” and then says I in a kind of a blind way, “I
have got other business that I feel that it is my duty
to tend to.”</p>

<p>But he didn’t seem to be willin’, and I wouldn’t go
without his consent. And so it went on, Josiah hangin’
back, and my principles a goarin’ me. It wore on
me. My dresses begun to hook up looser on me, and
finally one mornin’, as I dallied over my second potato,
and my third egg, not eatin’ ’em with no appetite,
Josiah says to me, “What does ail you, Samantha, you
don’t eat nothin’, and you seem to be a runnin’ doun.”</p>

<p>Then I broached the subject to him agin. I expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
he would object. But he looked at me in a silent,
melankolly way for about one minute, and half or three
quarters of another, and then says he in a gentle but
firm accent,</p>

<p>“Samantha if I can sell the old critter you can
go.”</p>

<p>So I was left in uncertainty (as it were) for I knew
he wouldn’t sell it for less than the price he had sot
it, and no knowin’ whether it would fetch it or not.
But I felt in my heart a feelin’ that I should go off on
that tower. And so I gradually but silently began
makin’ preperations, I quietly and calmly took two
breadths out of my brown alapaca dress and goared
’em and put a overskirt on to it, for I was determined
not to go to New York village without a overskirt on
to me. Not that I care about such triflin’ things myself,
but I felt that I was representin’ a great cause,
and I wasn’t goin’ to put our cause to open shame by
not havin’ on a overskirt. Men sometimes say that
great and strong minded wimmen are slack in the
matter of dressin’ up, I was determined to show ’em
that that weakness wasn’t mine. I wasn’t goin’ to be
all tattered out, with ends and tag locks of bows and
pleatin’s, and tow curls and frizzles, but I felt there
was a megium course to pursue, and I was determined
to hit against it.</p>

<p>Then agin I felt that the color of my dress suited
the great cause. I wasn’t goin’ rigged out in pink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
muslin, or sky-blue cambric, or anything of that sort.
A good solid sensible brown seemed to be jest the
thing. Black would have seemed too much in the
mournin’ line, as if we was despondent when we
wasn’t. White book muslin would have looked as if
my principles was too thin, and I was too light and
triflin’, and didn’t realize the great issues dependent
on to me. No; brown alapaca with a overskirt I felt
was jest what the anxious nation required of me, as
I stood face to face with the future President of the
United States&mdash;with my spectacles calmly gazin’ into
his’en, a influencin’ him in the cause of Right.</p>

<p>Another reason, I won’t deny, influenced me in tryin’
to get a good pattern for my overskirt so as to
have it set good, (I got it of Miss Gowdey and made
it a little bigger round the waist,) I thought more’n
likely as not Horace’s and my picture would be took,
and in the future would be hung up by the side of
that good honest old Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation.</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen’s wife influencin’ Horace in the
Great Cause of Wimmen’s Rights.”</p>

<p>And though I haint vain, I thought how poor it
would be, and what a eye sore to the nation if my
dress didn’t hang good. And how pleasin’ it would
be both to America and Josiah, to see me dressed in
a noble and becomin’ way. So I finished my overskirt,
and silently done up my best petticoat, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the same mysterious manner I put some tape trimmin’
on to the bottom of it.</p>

<p>And so the long and tegus days passed away from
me. I felt that suspense was a wearin’ on me. Josiah
see that it was. And on Saturday mornin’ I see
him pensively leanin’ over the barn yard fence, mewsin’
as it was, and pretty soon he hitched up the old
mare, and went to Jonesville, and when he came back
he says to me, in sorrowful tones but some composed,</p>

<p>“Samantha, you can start to-morrow if you want
to, I have sold the old critter.”</p>

<p>And then he added pensively. “I wish you would
have a few griddle cakes for supper, with some maple
molasses on to ’em.”</p>

<h2 id="GOVERNED_BY_PRINCIPLES">GOVERNED BY PRINCIPLES.</h2>

<p>On the next Monday mornin’, I let loose to my feelin’s
as it was, and begun to make open preparations.
I baked up the best vittles the house afforded, for I
determined Josiah should live like a king durin’ his
temporary widowerhood. Then after I got through
bakin’ and got the house clean as a pin, I commenced
to fix a dress to wear on the journey, for of course I
wasn’t goin’ to wear my best dress with a overskirt on
the railway. I am a master hand for bein’ careful of
my clothes, and I knew it would almost spile one of
my best dresses, but I had a calico dress as good as
new. It was a dark blue ground work with a handsome
sprig on it, and after I took up two tacks in it, I
felt that it was jest the thing to wear on the tower.</p>

<p>I had jest put it on, and had got the lookin’ glass
onto the floor to see if it cleared the floor enough, when
Thomas Jefferson come in, and says he,</p>

<p>“Your dress is too short, mother, I hate to see short
dresses, they look so hihorsical.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>I answered him with dignity as I looked over my
shoulder into the glass,</p>

<p>“Samantha Allen, whose maiden name was Smith,
haint a goin’ to mop out the cars for the railroad company,
free gratis for nothin’,” and I added with still
more impressive dignity, as I hung up the lookin’
glass, “what you mean by hihorsical I don’t know.”</p>

<p>He said it was a compound word derived from the
Greek, “high,” to intoxicate, and “horsical,” a race
horse, which two words strained off from the dead language
and biled doun into English meant “hihorsical.”</p>

<p>I told him “I didn’t care for his Greek, I didn’t care
if it was dead, not a mite, I shouldn’t cry over it,” and
I told him further, fixin’ my gray eyes upon him serenely,
“that there was two or three words that wasn’t
dead, that he would do well to strain off, and bile doun,
and take ’em for a stiddy drink.”</p>

<p>He wanted to know what they was, and I told him
plainly they was “Mind your own business.”</p>

<p>He said he would bile ’em doun, and take ’em stiddy
as a clock, and pretty soon he started off for Jonesville&mdash;he
had staid to home that day to help his father.
And I went on with a serene face a makin’ my preparations.
Josiah didn’t hardly take his eyes off of my
face, as I made ’em. He sot in a dejected way, a
claspin’ the World in his two hands, with a sad look
onto his face. He hated to think of my leavin’ him,
and goin’ off on a tower. I see he did, and I says to
him in a real affectionate tone,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>“Josiah, haint there nothin’ I can do for you in
New York, haint you got any errands to the village?”</p>

<p>He rubbed his bald head in deep thought for a minute
or two, and then says he, (he thinks everything of
the World,) “The nigger barber’s wife to Jonesville
came pretty near runnin’ away with another nigger
last night; if you have time I should love to have you
go to the Editer of the World and tell him of it. I
am afraid,” says he, and a gloomy, anxious look over-spread
his eye-brow, “I am afraid he haint heard of
it.”</p>

<p>I answered him in a soothin’ tone, “That I guessed
he had heard of it before now, I guessed it would be
in the next week’s World,” and Josiah kinder chirked
up and went out to work.</p>

<p>The next day I took ten pounds of butter, and 4
dozen of eggs and Josiah carried me to Jonesville to
trade ’em out, to get necessarys for me to wear on my
tower. I didn’t begrech layin’ out so much expense,
neither did Josiah, for we both knew that as I was
gettin’ pretty well along in years, it wasn’t likely I
should ever go off on a tower agin. And then I had
been prudent and equinomical all my days, and it
wasn’t no more than right that I should launch out
now in a liberal way.</p>

<p>But all the time I was workin’ over that butter,
and all the time I was countin’ out them eggs,
Horace was in my mind. Hangin’ such hopes on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
him as I hung, I felt that I must do somethin’ openly,
to give vent to my patriotic feelin’s in regard to him.</p>

<p>I never had wore hats, for I felt that I was too old
to wear ’em. But now as I was startin’ off to Jonesville
to get necessarys to wear on my mission to that
great and good Horace, I felt that principle called
on me to come out openly, and wear a white hat with
a feather. And I felt that Josiah as the husband of
Josiah Allen’s wife, and the carrier of her to get
them necessarys, must also wear one.</p>

<p>The father of Josiah, had left to him with other
clothin’, a large white fur hat. As the old gentleman
hadn’t wore it for some 40 or 50 years prior to
and before his desease, (he died when Thomas J. was
a baby) it wasn’t in the hight of fashion. But says I,
“Josiah Allen in the name of Horace and principle
will you wear that hat?”</p>

<p>Says he, “I hate to like a dog, for they will think I
have stole the Baptist steeple, and am wearin’ it for
a hat.” But seein’ my sad dissapointed look, says he,
“If you say so Samantha, I will wear it for once.”</p>

<p>Says I with dignity, “It is not your wife, formally
Samantha Smith, that says so, it is principle.”</p>

<p>“Wall!” says he “fetch it on.” Josiah was awful
clever to me, I guess it is natural for all men to
conduct themselves cleverer when they are about to
lose their pardners for a spell.</p>

<p>The hat <em>was big</em>. I couldn’t deny it. And Josiah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
bein’ small, with no hair to fill it up, as I lifted it up
with both hands and set it onto him, his head went
right up into it, the brim takin’ him right across the
bottom of his nose.</p>

<p>Says he, out from under the hat, “There hain’t no
use a talkin’ Samantha, I can’t never drive the old
mare to Jonesville in this condition, blind as a bat.”</p>

<p>But I explained it to him, that by windin’ a piller-case,
or somethin’ round the top of his head, the hat
would fit on, jest as you would fix a small cork into
a big bottle.</p>

<p>So that bein’ arrainged, my next thought was for
my own hat, and I thought mournfully as I examined
it, mine would be as much too small as his was too
big; it was an old one of Tirzah Ann’s, it was pure
white, but it was small for <em>her</em>, and nobody could
have got me even to have tried it onto my head, for
love or money. But in such a nature as J. Allen’s
wife’s, <em>principle</em> is all in all.</p>

<p>And as I looked in the glass and see how awfully I
looked in it, a feelin’ of grandeur&mdash;self sacrificin’ nobility
and patrotism swelled up in me, and made my
face look redder than ever, I am naturally very fresh
colored. And I felt that for the sake of Horace and
principle, I could endure the burnin’ sun, and mebby
the scoffs and sneers of Jonesville, they bein’ most all
on the side of Grant. I took a old white silk bunnet
linin’ of mine, and put a new bindin’ round the edge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
it bein’ formally bound with pink. And then after
readin’ a chapter in Fox’es Book of Martyrs&mdash;a soul
stirrin’ chapter, concernin’ them that was biled in oil
and baked on gridirens for principle&mdash;I sallied out to
get a feather to put onto it.</p>

<p>We hadn’t no white feathers by us, and I shouldn’t
have felt like runnin’ Josiah into any extra expense
to buy one, if there had been a feather store in the door
yard. But our old rooster “Hail the Day,” as Thomas
Jefferson calls him, had the most curlin’est, and foamin’est
tail feathers you ever see, white as snow. And
inspired by the most pure and noble and lofty sentiments
that can animate the human breast, I chased up
that old rooster for nigh onto half an hour. At last I
cornered him behind the barn, and as I held him tight
to my breast, and pulled out by main strength two
long slim feathers, that quirled and waved in a invitin’
manner, I says to him,</p>

<p>“This is hard for you, old Hail the Day. But you
are not the rooster I take you to be, you are not like
your mistress, if you are not willin’ to suffer in the
cause of Right.”</p>

<p>He flopped his wings, when I let him go, and crowed
nobly. I fixed the feathers in and we set out. But
I was more scairt than hurt in the line of scoffs. As
we went into Jonesville not a scoff did I see&mdash;not a
single scoff. No! they all smiled as they looked at us,
they see the power of principle, and they was proud
of us. Some of ’em laughed, they admired us so.</p>

<p>We drove up to the store and I went in with my
butter and eggs, Josiah havin’ business to the blacksmiths.
The clerk looked at me, and he smiled, and
says he,</p>

<p>“I see you are for Horace Greeley.” He almost
snickered but he checked himself, looked meachin’, as
he see my keen gray eye fixed onto his hat which he
had on, it was a kind of a mice coler, no principle shone
on it of any kind.</p>

<p>“Yes,” says I, “I am for Horace,” and agin I looked
keenly and searchin’ly at that hat, and says I “Be
you on either side or be you on the fence?”</p>

<p>“Wall,” says he “I am kinder on the fence at the
present time. But I didn’t get up there because I
am a coward, I got up there through policy; when
you are on the fence, you haint a steppin’ on the feet
of either party, it is a safe place, and it is a sightly
place, you can see better than you can on the ground.”</p>

<p>“When do you calculate to get off?” says I.</p>

<p>“Oh right after ’lection,” says he. “I shall get off
on the side that beats.”</p>

<p>I see here was a chance for me to do good and says I,</p>

<p>“Young man, ridin’ a fence never carried any man
or woman into nobility or honor,” says I, “you may
saddle and bridle a fence with all the velvet cushioned
caution, and silver mounted excuses, and shinin’ policy
you are a mind to, but you never could get Josiah Allen’s
wife on to it, she had ruther walk afoot,” says I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
“them brave warriors that go canterin’ doun life’s battle
field, leadin’ on the forlorn hope in the cause of
Right, don’t go ridin’ a fence.”</p>

<p>He looked stricken, and I asked him in a milder
tone to look at his green braige for viels. He took off
that hat and threw it doun behind the counter, and
brought out the braige, and I bought right there on
the spot a yard and a quarter of it. I then bought a
pair of new cotton gloves, a good sized umbrella, a pair
of morocco shoes, a pair of pink elastic garters, and
two as good stockin’s as Jonesville afforded, and butter
would pay for. I haint one to flounce the outside of
the platter, and let the inside go bony and ragged. I
haint no opinion of wolves on the outside, and sheep
on the inside, I want to be sheep clear to the bone, in
dress as well as principle. Wall, who should come into
the store, jest as I was examinin’ the green braige
through my spectacles, but Betsey Bobbet. My purchases
lay all round me on the counter, and says she,</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen’s wife, what means this extravagant
outlay of expendature?”</p>

<p>Says I, as coolly as if I went there every mornin’ before
breakfast,</p>

<p>“I am goin’ to New York village on a tower.”</p>

<p>She fairly screamed out, “What a coincidence!”</p>

<p>Says I calmly, “It haint no such thing, it is green
braige for a viel. It is 75 cents a yard.”</p>

<p>“You do not understand me, Josiah Allen’s wife,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
says she. “I mean that it is so singulah and coinciding
that I am goin’ theah too. Cousin Melindy, she
that married Ebenezah Williams, is just goin’ with
the consumption. And I felt that duty was a drawin’
of me theah. As I told motheh, in case of anything’s
happenin’, in case that Melindy should expiah, how
sweet and soothin’ it would be to Ebenezah to have
somebody theah, that could feel for him. It would
about kill Ebinezah to lose Melindy, and I feel that
it would be so sweet and comfortin’ for him to have
somebody on hand to lean on;” she smiled sweetly as
she continued, “there is almost a certainty that Melindy
is about to be took from our aching hearts. But
I fall back on the scripture, and on my duty, and try
to feel as if I could give her up. When do you
start?”</p>

<p>“Thursday mornin’,” says I in a tone as cold as a
grindstone in January, for I see what was before me.</p>

<p>She clasped her two hands and smiled on me two
times, and cried out agin, “Oh, what anotheh coincidence!
jest the day I was intending to embark. Oh,”
says she, “how sweet it will be for you to have a congenial
companion on the way, as the poet Robinson
Selkirk sweetly singeth,</p>

<p class="noindent">Don’t you say so, Josiah Allen’s wife?”</p>

<p>“I respect Mr. Sage,” says I, “he is a man I admire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
and Mr. Selkirk don’t know beans,” and I added in
frigid tones, “when the bag is untied.” I see that
my emotions was a gettin’ the better of me, I see my
principals was a totterin’. I recollected that I was a
member of the Methodist meetin’ house, and the words
of a him come back to me, with a slight change in ’em
to suit the occasion.</p>

</div>

<p>I turned and shouldered my cross.</p>

<p>“Betsey we will set sail together Thursday mornin’.”
I then turned silently and left the store, for I
felt than any further effort would have been too much
for me.</p>

<p>Thursday mornin’ found me to the depott in good
season. Betsey also was on time. I didn’t feel
haughty nor at all proud, but still I felt that I was a
independent householder startin’ to New York village
on a tower at my own expense. I see that all
the car folks felt friendly towards me for thier was
a pleasant smile on their faces every time they
looked at me and Betsey.</p>

<p>I wasn’t trimmed off so much as Betsey, but
I looked well. I had on that good calico dress, a
large black silk mantilly, a good shirred silk bunnet
large enough to shade my face some, my bran new
cotton gloves, my veil and my umbrell.</p>

<p>Betsey, I always thought put on too much to look
well, howsomever everybody to their own mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
She had on a pale blue parmetta dress, with flounces
and puckers onto it, a overskirt and a greek bender of
the same, trimmed with checkered delain, out on a
biasin’, a close fittin’ bask of the delain, which was
pink and yellow plaid and which was pinked out on
the edge with a machine. She had on a white bobbinet
lace hat, jest big enough to cover her bump of
self-esteem, trimmed with red and yellow roses and
long ends of otter colored ribbon and white lace, then
she had long cornelian ear rings, a string of beads
round her neck, and a locket and a big blue breast
pin and a cornelian cross. A pair of new white cotton
gloves, trimmed with two rows of broad white cotton
edgin’ five cents a yard&mdash;for I seen her buy it&mdash;and
two horsehair bracelets. And with her new teeth
and her long bran new tow curls, and waterfalls and
frizzles all full of otter colored rosettes, I tell you she
looked gay.</p>

<p>She says to me as she met my keen gaze.</p>

<p>“I don’t know but what you think I am foolish
Josiah Allen’s wife, in enrobing myself in my best a
coming on the road. But these are my sentiments.
I knew we should get theah before night, and I
should proceed at once to Ebinezah’s, and if anything
should be a happening, if it should be the house of
mourning, I thought it would be so comforting to
Ebinezah, to see me looking beautiful and cheerful.
Yon know theah is everything in first impressions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
I mean of course,” she added hastily, “that I am
that sorry for poor lonely widdowers and especially
Ebinezah, that if I could be a comfort to them, I
would be willing to sacrifice a tablespoonful of my
heart’s best blood, much moah this blue parmetta
dress. These are my sentiments Josiah Allen’s
wife.”</p>

<p>Says I coldly, “I should know they was yours Betsey,
I should know they was yours, if I should meet
’em in my porridge dish.”</p>

<p>But the time drew near for the cars to bear me
away from Josiah, and I began to feel bad.</p>

<p>I don’t believe in husbands and wives partin’ away
from each other, one livin’ in Europe, and one in
New York village, one in Wall street, and the other
on a Long Branch, one in Boston, and the other in
North America. As the poet truly observes,</p>

<p>“When the cat is away the mice’s will go to
playin’.”</p>

<p>As for me, I want my husband Josiah where I can
lay my hand on him any time, day or night, I know
then what he is about. Though so far as jealousy is
concerned, Bunker Hill monument, and Plymouth
Rock would be jest as likely to go to flirtin’ and cuttin’
up, as either of us. We have almost cast iron
confidence in each other. But still it is a sweet
and satisfyin’ thought to know jest where your consort
is, and what he is about, from hour to hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Josiah and me didn’t shed no tears as we each of
us parted, though our hearts ached with anguish we
both of us felt it our duty to be calm. I felt a tear
risin’ to my eye, but with a almost fearful effort I
choked it back and said in low accents as we
grasped holt of each others hands at partin’,</p>

<p>“Good by, Josiah, remember to feed the hens, and
keep the suller door shet up.”</p>

<p>He too struggled nobly for composure and conquered,
and in a voice of marble calm he said,</p>

<p>“Good by Samantha, don’t spend no more money
than is necessary.”</p>

<p>The Ingin hitched to the front car give a wild yell,
as if he felt our two woes&mdash;Josiah’s and mine&mdash;and we
parted for the first time in goin’ on 15 years.</p>

<p>As I sunk back on the wooden bottomed car seat,
perfectly onmanned by my efforts at commandin’
myself, for the first time I felt regret at my wild
and perilous undertakin’.</p>

<h2 id="MEETING_GRANT_AND_COLFAX">MEETING GRANT AND COLFAX.</h2>

<p>We had to change cars about noon, as we went into
the depot to get our tickets, the ticket man looked
so kinder lonesome stuck in there alone, for all the
world as if he had done somethin’ and his mother
had shet him up, that I thought I would make a little
talk with him.</p>

<p>He favored Celestine Wilkins’es husband considerable,
jest such a meachin’ lookin’ feller, and I knew
Celestine’s husband had a brother down this way
somewhere, and so to kinder open a conversation with
him, I asked him “If he ever had any relation that
married a girl by the name of Gowdey?”</p>

<p>You ought to have heard how that feller snapped
me up&mdash;he couldn’t have answered me any shorter,
if I had asked him to run away with me.</p>

<p>But thinks’es I to myself, he has got morbid
through lonesomness. I pitied him shet up alone
there, and so in a few minutes I begun agin.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know but he was your brother, he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
a good deal such a meachin’ look to him,” and says I,
“The country round here hain’t so pleasant as Jonesville,
do you think it is sir?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t know or care nothin’ about Jonesville.”</p>

<p>His tone was sharper than that sword aged two,
that the bible tells of.</p>

<p>Says I, “Young man you needn’t take my head
quite off, if you never did see Jonesville nor had any
other advantages. I hain’t to blame for it.” And
thinks’es I to myself, you may be lonesome for all of
me, you may die of lonesomness for all I care, I
shan’t try to make any more talk with you to make
your time pass off easier.</p>

<p>We got on to the cars agin and got a good seat. I
wanted to set by an open winder, and Betsey didn’t.
I mistrust she thought the wind would take the kink
out of her frizzles, and so she went on a seat or 2
ahead of me. There was a lot of fashionable lookin’
folks came in too, and one of ’em came along and set
right down in the seat with me, the cars bein’ pretty
full. She was dressed up like a doll, but she didn’t
act stuck up a mite, my opinion is, she knew what
belonged to good manners, and I offered her some
caraway, for I liked her looks. She took it and
thanked me for it, and says I to make talk with her,</p>

<p>“Are you goin’ far on the cars?”</p>

<p>She said, “She wasn’t goin’ far on this route, she
was goin’ to a waterin’ place.”</p>

<p>“How far?” says I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh 2 or 300 miles,” says she.</p>

<p>“Good land!” says I, “Can’t you find any water
nearer hum? Why,” says I, “I should think you
would be choked before you got there.” Says I,
“Our cistern and well sometimes gives out in hot
weather, but Josiah always draws water from the
creek,” why says I, full of pity for her, “If I hadn’t
any water to the house, and nobody to draw it for me
I should rather drive myself to the creek and water
myself 3 times a day, than to start off on the cars so
far after it. Howsumever every body to their own
mind.”</p>

<p>She kinder laughed with her eyes, and, said somethin’
about “seasides” and “sea bathin’” or somethin’
and I felt it was my duty to say to her,</p>

<p>“You needn’t go 300 miles for that, you can get
good seasides to Jonesville for 75 cents. Tirzah Ann,
Josiah’s girl by his first wife, got one for that. I don’t
wear hats myself, except,” says I with dignity, “in
the cause of Right and for the good of the Human
Race. And as for seein’ bathin’, I myself would go
the other way, ruther than foller it up; howsumever
everybody to thier own taste.” But I kep’ thinkin’
of it, and I couldn’t help breakin’ out agin, and speakin’
my mind; says I, in a good deal colder accents, “I
would as soon go to a horse race&mdash;and sooner,” for the
more I thought of it the more I thought that no virtuous
woman would start off 300 miles to see bathin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
goin’ on. I acted offish after that, and was sorry I had
give her the caraway.</p>

<p>Her face looked red, and she started up and went
back and sot doun by some of her mates, and I was
glad she did. She pretended to be a laughin’, and
she was talkin’ to ’em awful busy; but I see one eye
was on me the most of the time&mdash;she felt guilty.</p>

<p>At the very next station house two fellers come in
that everybody seemed to be lookin’ at, and payin’ attention
to. But they didn’t seem to mind it. They
come in and sot doun right in the seat between me
and Betsey.</p>

<p>After they had sot doun, one of ’em took a cigar out
of his pocket, and put it in his mouth. It wasn’t lit,
but he held it between his teeth as if it was a great
comfort to him. Thinks’es I, it is kinder queer works,
but I can stand it if the R. R. Company can. But
Betsey leaned her head back, and says to him,</p>

<p>“Was you aware, kind sir, that cigars was confiscated
on the cars?”</p>

<p>He didn’t say a word, but held on to it with his
teeth as if it was dreadful comfortin’ to him. And
she asked him over again. But not a word did he
say. I guess she asked him five times&mdash;but not a
word did she get out of him. And then she turned to
the feller with him, the smilin’ chap, and says she,</p>

<p>“Is your companion a deaf male?”</p>

<p>He smiled. Agin she asked him,</p>

<p>“Is your pardner deprived of his eahs?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh no,” says he, “he has got ears,” and agin he
smiled.</p>

<p>Thinks’es I, it is pretty queer works, but it is none
of my business. I guess we had rode nigh on to an
hour in jest that way, Betsey kinder oneasy and nestlin’
round, I calm and placid in demeaniour and
one of the men between us a holdin’ that cigar in his
mouth, as if it was indeed consolin’, and the other one
a smilin’ blandly, at nothin’ in particular. Everybody
in the cars seemed to be a lookin’ at ’em, and thinks’es
I, it is no wonder, for of all the good natured lookin’
men I ever see, he is the cap sheaf. Thinks’es I, I
wish every ticket agent in the world could have his
benine face to hang up before ’em, for a sampler, for
if there was ever a race that had the appearance of
bein’ brought up on vinegar and ten-penny nails, it is
them.</p>

<p>After a while, I got kinder hungry. My basket
hung right up over them two men, and I rose up, and
went to reach up for it, when the smilin’ chap got up
a smilin’ and says he to me, “Can’t I assist you, madam?”
and he reached up smilin’ as sweet as a rose, to
take it doun, when all of a sudden the handle slipped
out at one end, and doun come the contents right on
to his face. One nut-cake, a long, slim one, sot up
straight on his nose, as handsome as you ever see a
circus man ride a white horse. But most mournful of
all, I had some biled eggs, and unbeknown to me, Tirzah
Ann had took ’em out too quick, before they was
much more than warmed through, and they broke onto
his face and all run doun into his whiskers. But if
you will believe it, that blessed man smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>Thinks I to myself, “Good land! was there ever
such a clever critter on earth?” I handed him a
clean towel, and told him I was sorry. But he
smiled, and said, “it wasn’t any matter,” and wiped
his sweetly smilin’ face, and handed the towel back
smilin’.</p>

<p>The other feller never said a word, though one of
the eggs broke onto the legs of his white pantaloons.
Jest at this crisis, a tall man with whiskers came up,
and said somethin’ to ’em, and they got up and went
to the other end of the car, where there was a lot
of smart lookin’ men. As they went by me the
clever feller slipped on a piece of orange peel, and a
most fell. But if you will believe it, the critter
smiled.</p>

<p>I see that all of them smart lookin’ men acted
dreadful reverential towards the two, and I says to a
bystander behind me, “Can you tell me sir who that clever critter is, and
the other one?” Says he, “That is Skyler Colfax, and
General Grant.”</p>

<p>I rose right up in my seat, for at the mention of
them two honored names, such emotions rushed onto
me&mdash;that it drownded out fear, and all the shrinkin’
bashfulness of my sect, and I forgot in that wrapped
moment that I wasn’t Josiah, and I advanced right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
onwards towards them two noble men. Every man
round ’em see the lofty expression onto my face, and
kinder fell back, and I walked right up and gripped
Skylers’es hand with one of mine, while I held my
umbrell in the other tremblin’ with emotion.</p>

<p>“Skyler, I am glad Tirzah Ann took ’em out too
quick.”</p>

<p>He didn’t know what I meant, but that blessed man
smiled, and agin I spoke in the same tremblin’ tones.</p>

<p>“I am glad they was rare done.”</p>

<p>Agin he smiled, and agin I spoke, and I mastered
my feelin’s, with a effort, and spoke out loud and clear,</p>

<p>“The hen that laid them eggs, never shall do another
day’s work as long as my name is Josiah Allen’s
wife. I know jest which one laid ’em, for old speckle
face’s eggs are so big that we always keep ’em for our
own use.” Says I, “it makes me proud and happy
to think I am the owner of that hen, for if it hadn’t
been for them eggs, I never should have felt so well
acquainted with you. If it hadn’t been for them eggs
that broke onto your good and honored face, I never
should have had the privilege of graspin’ holt of your
hand and sayin’ to you what I now say, that though
goodness and patience and faithfulness may be made
light of by some, they are jest what is goin’ to carry
Uncle Sam triumphant onward, with a smilin’ face,
when the egg shells of uncivil war break on his honest
face, and thier yelks run down into his whiskers.”</p>

<p>Here my feelin’s almost overcame me agin, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
he smiled at me, and spoke kinder pleasant to me&mdash;and
smiled agin, I turned silently away and grasped holt
of General Grant’ses hand, and says I, in still more
chokin’ accents&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ulysses this is a proud day for Josiah Allen’s wife,”
says I, “Ulysses how do you do?”</p>

<p>He didn’t say nothin’ but nodded kinder pleasant
to me, and I says in the same almost tremblin tones
for I knew he thought every thing of his relations.
“How is Mr. Dents’es folks, are they all enjoying good
health?” He nodded agin kinder pleasant but didn’t
say a word, and I proceeded on&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ulysses you have freed the land from war and
bloodshed. Wherever the smoke of that peaceful cigar
has smoked, it has drove before it the blood red cloud
of war and treason.” But says I, “that haint the main
reason why I thought you ought to be President, and
so I have told Josiah. I have said to Josiah more’n a
hundred times that any man or woman ought to be
President that knew enough not to talk when they
hadn’t nothin’ to say. But&mdash;” says I, for even in that
wrapped moment stern principle was the guide of J.
Allen’s wife&mdash;“That was when you was run up for President
the first time; I go now for Horace Greeley, and
so does Josiah.”</p>

<p>There haint nothin’ little and envious about Ulysses
Grant, he didn’t act mad a mite, he nodded to me
agin as friendly as ever, and after invitin’ them both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
in the name of Josiah, to make it thier home with us
whenever they come to Jonesville, and sendin’ my
best respects to Julia and Mr. Dents’es folks, and Skylers’es
wife Elliner, I retired to my seat and sot down.</p>

<p>When Betsey discovered who I had been talkin’
with, she looked wild at the thought, but it didn’t
rouse in her, the spontanious emotions of patrotism it
did in me. If a barell has been filled up with rain
water, you can’t expect to tap it and have it run strong
beer. When any sudden circumstance taps folks’es
minds, they will run out of ’em jest what they have
been filled with, no more, no less. My mind was that
filled with noble emotions of admiration and patrotism,
that I entirely forgot for the minute that I was
J. Allen’s wife from Jonesville. But Betsey all the
while remembered B. Bobbet, she also remembered
her poetry. I don’t believe a few earthquakes could
make her forget that, her first words was after she
recovered herself,</p>

<p>“I will make General Grant, that deah, sweet man,
a present. Everybody does, that wants to get onto
the right side of him. I will give him a piece of my
poetry. If I remember rightly I have got one in my
satchel bag, all printed out, with a running vine
around the edges. There is 45 verses of it, and it
is on the war. How fortunate that I brought it
along.” And as she dove her hands into her satchel
bag, she continued dreamily,</p>

<p>“Mebby he is that liberal and generous turn with
his own folks, that after he has read it, he will give
it to some of his wife’s relations. Mebby there is a
few widowehs among them,” and then in a still
more dreamy tone she murmured, “Betsey B. Dent,
Washington, D. C.” But anon or a little after, she
roused out of this revery and takin’ the poetry in
her hand, she started down the car, and I bein’ tired,
leaned my head back against the side of the seat, and
composed myself together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a><br /><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">“LET US HAVE PEACE.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>I guess I had most got into a nap, when I heard a
loud wrathful, eloquent voice, seemin’ly makin’ a
speech to some enimy. It started me up so that I
rose right up onto my feet, and looked round, and
there was that noble General, standin’ up with his
hands extended, layin’ it down strong and decided.
I knew what it was in ½ a minute, Betsey Bobbet
had done what a five years uncivel war couldn’t do,
nor a admirin’ nation of 20 million souls. She had
got him to makin’ a speech, while Skyler who had
smiled stidely for upwards of 40 years, stood lookin’
on with a dark and awfully gloomy frown onto him.</p>

<p>I stood silent for some time lost in the sorrowful
feelin’s the scene called forth, and then almost overcome
with my pity for them, I wended my way
towards them. As I drew nearer to them, I heard his
words which he was pourin’ out so eloquently and
fluently, “Let us have peace, <em>Can’t</em> we have peace?”
he was yellin’ in such harrowin’ tones, that there
wasn’t hardly a dry eye in my head as I listened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have I escaped from the horrible danger of war,
have I survived the open bullets of my enimies, and
the well meanin’ but almost fatal arrows of my
friends, to expier in this way? To perish by poetry?
Is there no sucker for me? <em>Can’t</em> we have peace?” he
screamed in a loud preachin’ tone as he ketched sight
of me, “Can’t we have it, <em>say</em>?”</p>

<p>He was almost delerious. But I laid my hand on
his agitated elbow, and says I in soothin’ tones.</p>

<p>“Yes Ulysses, you <em>shall</em> have a piece, you shall,
Josiah Allen’s wife will see to it, you <em>shall</em> have a
piece.”</p>

<p>And then I leaned down and whispered a few words
into Betsey Bobbett’s left ear, and she turned
quicker’n a flash, and gathered up her poetry and
rushed into the forward car.</p>

<p>As she disapeared, Skyler’ses face changed from
that gloomy sinister frown, and agin he put on that
smile that was upwards of 40 years old, but was still
so sweet and fresh that I knew it was good for
another 40 years&mdash;and the General grasped me by
the hand sayin’ in agitated tones,</p>

<p>“There was upwards of 50 of ’em, and she would
read ’em.” Says I soothingly, “I wouldn’t think of
it Ulysses, it is all over now. I was glad to show the
gratitude the nation owes to you. I was glad of the
chance to befriend you.”</p>

<p>“Angel!” says he almost warmly. But I interupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
him by sayin’ in a tone of dignity. “I honor and
respect you deeply Ulysses&mdash;but in the two names of
Julia and Josiah, I must forbid your callin’ me angel,
or any other pet name.”</p>

<p>I knew it was only his deep gratitude to me for
rescuin’ him from his peril that made him say it, for he
and Julia think the world of each other. And the
good solid principles, colored and morally struck in
with tan bark in his early life, the muddy waters of
political life haint been able to wash out, nor the gilt
tinsel of fashionable life to cover up and destroy. I
knew that even there in Washington Avenue, among
all the big men there, he loved his wife, jest as much
as if it was the fashion to love ’em. I knew all this,
but still I felt that I must speak as I did, for principle
with J. Allen’s wife&mdash;as I have remarked more
formally&mdash;is all in all.</p>

<p>I then turned and followed Betsey, not knowin’
but what she would be a comin’ back. What I whispered
in her left ear was this, that her back hair was
comin’ down, and she bein’ so bald, I knew it would
fetch her down like a arrow in her breast.</p>

<p>They left at the next Station House, and Betsey
and me proceeded onwards to New York village with
no farther coincidences.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="AT_NEW_YORK_ASTERSES_TAVERN">AT NEW YORK, ASTERS’ES TAVERN.</h2>

<p>The cars didn’t bust up nor break down, which surprised
me some, but which I felt was indeed a
blessin’, and at ½ past six Betsey and me stood on
the platform of the depott at New York village. As
we stood there I would have swapped my last new
cross barred muslin night cap in my satchel bag on
my arm for a pair of iron ears. I should have been
glad of the loan of a old pair for 16 seconds, if I
couldn’t got ’em no longer, the noise was so distractin’
and awful.</p>

<p>Says I to myself, “Am I Josiah Allen’s wife, or
am I not?” some of the time I thought I was Josiah,
I was so destracted. But though inwardly so tosted
up and down, I kep’ a cool demeaniour outside of me.
I stood stun still, firmly graspin’ my satchel bag, my
umberell and my green cap box&mdash;with my best head
dress in it, till I had collected myself together, recolected
what my name was, and where I was a goin’.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
When my senses come back I thought to myself truly
Josiah wasn’t so far out of the way when he worried
over old Tammany, for of all the shameless and
brazen set, on the face of the earth, that set a howlin’
round Betsey Bobbet and me was the shamelessest
and brazenest.</p>

<p>Now I am naturaily pretty offish and retirin’ in my
ways, with strange men folks. I think it is becomin’
in a woman to be so, instead of bold. Now when we
sot sail from Jonesville, after we got well to ridin’, a
man came through the cars, a perfect stranger to me,
but he reached out his hand to shake hands with me,
jest as friendly and famelier as if I was his step mother.
But I didn’t ketch holt of his hand, as some
wimmen would, I jest folded up my arms, and says I,
coolly,</p>

<p>“You have got the advantage of me.”</p>

<p>But he never took the hint, there he stood stun
still in front of me holdin’ out his hand. And seein’
there was a lot of folks lookin’ on, and not wantin’ to
act odd, I kinder took holt of his hand and shook it
slightly, but at the same time says,</p>

<p>“Who under the sun you are I don’t know&mdash;but
you seem determined to get acquainted with me.
Mebby you are some of his folks I haint never seen&mdash;are
you related to Josiah on the Allen side or on
the Daggett side?” Josiah’s mother was a Daggett.</p>

<p>But before I could say any more he spoke up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
said all he wanted was my ticket. I was glad then I
had acted offish. For as I say, I don’t believe in wimmen
puttin’ themselves forward and actin’ bold. Not
that that stands in the way of their modistly claimin’
their honest rights. I have seen enough boldness
used by a passel of girls at one huskin’ bee, or apple
cut, to supply 4 presedential elections, and the same
number of female caurkusses, and then have 5 or 6
baskets full left. Havein’ these modest and reserved
feelin’s in my soul&mdash;as firm as firm iron&mdash;what was
my feelin’s as I stood there on that platform, when a
great tall villian walked up to me and yelled right up
close to my bunnet,</p>

<p>“Will you have a bus mom?”</p>

<p>If that man had the privilege of livin’ several hundred
years, he would say at the last 100, that he
never forgot the look I gave him as he uttered
these infamous words to me. It was a look calculated
to scorch a man to his very soul. It was a look calculated
and designed to make a man sigh for some
small knot hole to creep through and hide him from
the gaze of wimmen. I’ll bet 2 cents that he won’t
insult another women in that way very soon. I give
him a piece of my mind that he won’t forget in a
hurry. I told him plainly, “That if I wasn’t a
married women and a Methodist, and, was free to kiss
who I was a mind to, I had jest as lives kiss a anacondy,
or a boyconstructor, as him,” and I says in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
conclusion, “mebby you think because Josiah haint
here to protect me, you can talk to me as you are a
mind to. But,” says I, “if I haint got Josiah with
me I have got a good stout umberell.” He quailed
silently, and while he was a quailin’ I turned to
Betsey, and asked her if she was ready to start
along, for as true as I live and breathe, I was afraid
Betsey was so of that clingin turn, that she would be
a kissen’ some of them men in spite of my teeth,
for thier was a lot of ’em besettin’ her for a bus.
A yellin’ round her “have a bus? Have a bus?”
Jest as if that was jest what Betsey and me had
come from Jonesville for. The miserable&mdash;lowlived
creeters.</p>

<p>Betsey seemed to kinder hate to go, but I started
her off. For no burdock bur ever stuck to a horse’s
mane, as Josiah Allen’s wife sticks to a companion, a
drawin’ ’em along with her in the cause of Right. As
we wended our way along, walkin’ afoot, she wanted
to know what tavern I was a goin’ to put up to, and I
told her “Mr. and Miss Asters’es tavern.” Says she,
“If it was not jest as it was, I would ask you to go to
cousin Ebenezah’s with me. But in the future it may
be I shall be freer to act, than I be now. If I was a
married female and had a home of my own heah, how
happy I should be to welcome Jonesville to its blessed
presincts. As deah Tuppah observes&mdash;”</p>

<p>But I interrupted her by sayin’ coolly, “Betsey, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
have made up my mind to put up to Mr. Aster’ses,
for Johnothan Beans’es ex-wife, Josiah’s 2nd cousin,
is Miss Aster’ses hired girl.”</p>

<p>“Is she a widow?” says Betsey.</p>

<p>“She does a little in that line,” says I in a cautious
tone. “She is a vegetable widow.” I wasn’t goin’
to say “grass widow” right out, though she <em>is</em> clear
grass. For her husband, Johnothan Bean, run away
with another woman 3 years ago this comin’ fall, it
was all printed out in the World at the time. At that
very minute we turned on to Broadway, and Betsey
was a sailin’ on ahead of me in gay spirits, a laughin’,
and a talkin’, and a quotin’ Tupper, jest as happy as
you please. But as we turned the corner, I stopped
her by ketchin’ holt of her Greek bender, and says I,</p>

<p>“I’d have a little respect into me, Betsey Bobbet,”
says I. “Less stand still here, till the funeral procession
goes by.”</p>

<p>So we put a funeral look onto our faces, and stood
still a spell, and they streamed by. I thought my soul
there was no end to the mourners. It seems as if we
stood there decently and in order, with a solemn look
onto our faces, becomin’ the solemn occasion, for pretty
nigh ½ an hour. Finally I whispered to Betsey, and
says I,</p>

<p>“Betsey, did you ever see such a gang of mourners
in your life?”</p>

<p>I see her eyes looked kinder sot in her head, and
she seemed to be not really sensin’ what I said. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
looked strange. Finally says she, “It is a sorrowful
time, I am composin’ a funeral owed, and I will repeat
it to you soon.”</p>

<p>I wanted to get her mind off’en that idee, and I continued
on a talkin’,</p>

<p>“It must be some awful big man that is dead.
Like as not it is the Governor of the United States
or some deacon or other. Do see ’em stringin’ along.
But how some of the mourners are a behavin’, and
how gay some of the wimmen are dressed. If I had
known there was goin’ to be a funeral in the village,
while I was here, some of the mourners might have
had my black bombazeen dress, and my crape viel
jest as well as not. I always make a practice of
lendin’ ’em on funeral occasions.”</p>

<p>Jest then a little boy came sailin’ by, with a segar
in his mouth almost as big as <em>he</em> was. And I
ketched holt of him, and whispered to him,</p>

<p>“Bub who is dead?” and says I, “be you one of
the mourners?”</p>

<p>“Yes, old lady,” says he, in a impudent tone, “I
am out on a short mourn.”</p>

<p>If it hadn’t been for the mournful occasion, and
for gettin’ off’en my dignity, I would have spanked
him, then and there; he laughed so impudent at me.
But I let him go on, and then I took out my snowy
25 cent linen handkerchief and wiped off my heated
face, and says I to Betsey,</p>

<p>“I am wore out; there hain’t no end to this procession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
seemin’ly, we may as well go on, for I am
beat out, we shall act as well as some of the
mourners do any way, if we do walk on.” So we
wended on. Betsey’s cousin lived not a great ways
from Miss Asters’es, only it was down a little ways
another street, up over a store. I told her “I guessed
I wouldn’t climb up them grocery stairs, I was so
tuckered out, and then Miss Aster would most probable
have supper about ready, and I didn’t want to
have her fuss to set the table over for me, or steep
her tea over, and I felt that a cup of tea I must have.”</p>

<p>I was kinder dreadin’ goin’ in alone, not bein’
acquainted with Miss Aster, and I don’t know when I
have been tickleder, than I was to meet Jonothan
Beans’es ex-wife, right on the sidewalk. She was
real glad to see me too, for I befriended her when
she first went to grass, (as it was,) I took her right in
for 3 weeks, and give her 2 pair of seamed stockin’s,
and a lot of other things for her comfort.</p>

<p>She went right back with me. Of all the big
houses I ever see, Mr. Asters’es house beat everything.
I was determined not to act green and be a askin’
questions, and so I didn’t say a word. But I spose
from the size of it, that Mr. Aster lets part of it for
meetin’ houses, and mebby they have a few select
schools in it, and a few lunatick asylums, I should
think they would need ’em, such a noise. But I
didn’t say a word.</p>

<p>Jonothan Beans’es ex-wife told me I must put my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
name down on the Register before I went to my
room, I didn’t object, nor I didn’t ask no questions,
but I kep’ a pretty good look out. “Register!” I
knew I had heard somethin’ that sounded like that,
connected with deeds, and I wasn’t goin’ to sign
away my property. I didn’t know as it was so, but
I did have my thoughts, that mebby somebody had
told ’em I was comein’ to the village, and they was
tryin’ to get me to sign away my thirds, there is so much
iniquity in the world. But I kep’ my thoughts to
myself, and kep’ my eyes open. I jest looked over
the book pretty sharp, before I put my name down,
and I see it was all right. My room was on the
5th story, and I told J. Beans’es ex-wife that how
I was goin’ to climb up them stairs I didn’t know, I
was so tuckered out, I was sorry the minute I said
it, for I was afraid she would go and tell Miss Aster,
and Miss Aster would give up her bedroom to me, or
mebby she would make Mr. Aster sleep with one of
the boys, and have me sleep with her, and I wouldn’t
have her put herself out for the world. And I spoke
up and says I,</p>

<p>“I guess I can weather it some way.”</p>

<p>And she spoke up and says she, “Here is the
elevater, be carried up.”</p>

<p>There was a big nigger comin’ right towards us,
and I thought she meant him, for they have been called
such funny names ever since the war, that I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
likely “Elevater” was one of ’em. But I jest put my
foot right doun to once, says I firmly,</p>

<p>“I haint a goin’ to be lugged up stairs by that nigger.”
And then I was so afraid that he would hear it,
and it would hurt his feelin’s, that I spoke right up
pretty loud, and says I,</p>

<p>“It haint on account of the gentleman’s dark complexion
at all, that I object. But I don’t think Josiah
would like it, to have any other man carryin’ me round
in his arms.”</p>

<p>But Johnothan Beans’es ex-wife explained it to me.
There was a little room about as big as our smoke
house, all fixed off neat as a pin, and all we had to do
was to git in, and then we was histed right up in front
of our room. I was awful glad to be carried up, but
I have got some pity left into me, and I says to her,
says I,</p>

<p>“Haint it awful hard for the man that is drawin’ us
up?” Says I, “Is it Mr. Aster, or is it his hired man?”
and says I, “does he do it with a windlass, like a well
bucket? or hand over hand, like drawin’ up water out
of a cistern with a pole?”</p>

<p>Johnothan Beans’es ex-wife said it was done by machinery,
and she said, for I asked her the first thing,
“that there wasn’t no funeral, that there was jest such
a crowd every day.” I didn’t believe her, but I was
too beat out to contend. And glad enough was I, to
stretch my weary limbs in a rockin’ chair. J. Beans’es<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
ex-wife said she would fetch me up a cup of tea, and
my supper to me. She haint forgot the past.</p>

<p>She told me when she left me that night, to be
dreadful careful about the gass, and not blow it out;
she told me jest how it was done, and I’ll bet Mrs.
Aster herself couldn’t do it any neater, for I thought
of Josiah, and the thought of that man nerved me to
do it right, so as not to die and leave him a gass widower,
and a lonely man.</p>

<p>When I waked up in the mornin’ such a noise as I
heard. Why, I have thought sometimes when I was
sleepy, that our old rooster “Hail the Day” makes an
awful sight of noise. But good land! if all the roosters
in the United States and Boston, had roosted
right under my window, they couldn’t have begun
with it. My first thought as I leaped out of bed was,
“Jonesville is afire.” Then recollectin’ myself, I grew
calmer, and thought mebby Miss Aster had got breakfast
ready, and was a hollerin’ to me. And growin’
still more composed, I gin up that the tramplin’ and
hollerin’ was doun in the street. As I dressed me, I
lay out my work for the day; thinks’es I, “Betsey
Bobbet will be so took up with her mission to her
cousin Ebenezer’s, that I shall be rid of her!” It was
a sweet thought to me, and I smiled as I thought it.
But alas! as the poet well observes, “How little we
know what is ahead of us.” Thinks’es I, as I turned
the screw and let the water outen the side of the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
to wash me, (Johnothan Beans’es ex-wife had showed
me how the night before,) I must do all I can this day
in the cause of Right. If I get that destracted here
that I am threatened with luny, and have to leave before
my time comes, I will go where duty calls me
first and most. I should have been glad to have looked
round the village, and got acquainted with some of
Miss Aster’ses neighbors, but though I felt that the
neighborin’ wimmen might think I was real uppish
and proud sperited, still I felt that I could better
stand this importation than to desert the cause of
Right for ½ a minute. I felt that Horace, although
nearly perfect in every other respect, needed Josiah
Allen’s wife’s influence on a subject dear to that female’s
heart. And I felt that that deluded Miss Woodhull
needed a true and pure principled female to show
her plainly where she stood. Then I laid out to go
to Isabella Beecher Hooker’ses. And the time was
short, I knew with every fresh roar of destraction that
come up from the street below, that the time of my
stay in that village was short.</p>

<p>I was so almost lost in these thoughts, that I didn’t
see how late it was a gettin’. I had overslept myself
in the first place, bein’ so tuckered out the night before,
and thinks’es I all of a sudden,</p>

<p>“What will Miss Aster think, my keepin’ her from
eatin’ her breakfast so long?”</p>

<p>But inwardly, my mind was some composed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
thinkin’ it was principle that had belated me. So I
sailed doun stairs. I had put on my best clothes, my
head-dress looked foamin’, my overskirt stood out noble
round my form. And it was with a peaceful mind
though some destracted by the noise, that I wended
my way to the breakfast table.</p>

<p>But instead of all of us a settin’ to one table with
Miss Aster to the head, a pourin’ out tea, there was
I’ll bet, more’n a hundred little tables, with folks settin’
round ’em, a eatin’, and waiters a goin’ all round
amongst ’em, a waitin’ on ’em. And every man waiter
had got on one of his wives white bib aprons.
Thinks’es I to myself, what a tussle I should have
with Josiah, to get him to wear one of my aprons
round the house when I had company; he is awful sot
aginst wearin’ aprons, it is all I can do to get one on
to him when he is a churnin’.</p>

<p>Johnothan Beans’es ex-wife ketched my eye, as I
went in, and she came and sot me doun to a little table
where there wasn’t nobody. And then she was drawed
off by somebody and left me alone. And I spoke out
loud to myself,</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what I am goin’ to eat, unless I
lay to and eat stun china and glass ware.” And ketchin’
sight of the pepper box, I exclaimed almost convulsively,</p>

<p>“I never was much of a hand to eat clear pepper,
and nothin’ else.”</p>

<p>A nigger come up to me at that minute, and said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
somethin’ in a frenchified accent about a cart bein’ on
my plate, or somethin’ about a cart, and I see in a
minute that he wanted to make out&mdash;because I come
from the country&mdash;that I wanted a cart load of vittles.
I don’t know when I have been madder. Says I,</p>

<p>“You impudent creeter, you think because I am
from the country, and Josiah haint with me, that you
can impose upon me. Talk to me, will you, about my
wantin’ a cart load of vittles? I should be glad,” says
I in a sarcastic tone, “I should be glad to get somethin’
a little more nourishin’ than a three tined fork
and a towel to eat, but I don’t seem to run much chance
of gettin’ on it here.”</p>

<p>Before he had time to say anything, J. Beans’es ex-wife
came up, and said somethin’ to me about lookin’
at “Bill the Fair.” I looked down on the table, and
noticed then for the first time that there was a piece
of poetry layin’ there, seemin’ly cut out of some newspaper,
I see that she wanted me to read it, but I told
her, “That I wasn’t much of a hand for poetry anyway,
and Betsey Bobbet wrote so much that it made
me fairly sick of it,” and besides, says I, “I have left
my specks up stairs, I forgot ’em till I got most down
here.”</p>

<p>But jest then I happened to think, mebby she had
wrote it herself, I don’t want to hurt nobody’s feelin’s,
and says I, in a pleasant tone,</p>

<p>“I presume “Bill the Fair,” is a good piece of
poetry, and if you haint no objection, I will take it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
home with me, and put it into Tirzah Ann’s scrap
book.” She started off before I fairly got through
speakin’ and I folded up the poetry and put it into
my pocket, and in a minute’s time back she came with
some first rate vittles. She knows what I like jest as
well as I do, havin’ lived with us a spell, as I said,
when she first went to grass. She knows jest what a
case I am for store tea; but she asked me what kind
of tea I wanted, and I spoke right out before I
thought,</p>

<p>“Anything but sage tea, I can’t bear that.”</p>

<p>But then I happened to think I see they was all a
drinkin’ coffee round me, I knew they was by the
smell. And I thought mebby from her speakin’ to
me in that way that she meant to give me a little hint
that Miss Aster was out of store tea, and says I, kinder
loud for she had started off. “If Miss Aster is short
on it for store tea, she needn’t fuss for me, she
needn’t borry any on my account, I can drink sage
tea if I set out to.”</p>

<p>But I thought to myself, that I had rather have
brought a drawin’ of tea in my pocket clear from
Jonesville, than to have gone without it; while I was
jest thinkin’ this, Jonothan Beans’es ex-wife came
back with a first rate cup of tea, strong enough to
bear up a egg.</p>

<p>The more I looked round and see the droves of
hungry folks, the sorrier I felt for Miss Aster. And
I spoke to J. Beans’es ex-wife as she brought me my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
last vittles, says I, “If there is a woman on the face
of the hull earth I am sorry for, it is Miss Aster, how
on earth can she ever cook enough to fill this drove
of folks?” says I, “How can she ever stand up under
it?” And carried almost away with my sympathy,
I says to Jonothan Beans’es ex-wife,</p>

<p>“You tell Miss Aster from me that she needn’t
make no fuss about the dinner at all, I will eat a
picked up dinner, I had jest as lives as not, I didn’t
come down here to put her out and make her any
trouble.”</p>

<p>I heard a little noise to one side of me, and I looked
round and there was a feller and two girls a snickerin’
and laughin’, right at me. They was rigged out
awful fashionable, but I guess their brains had run to
their hair mostly, the girls on their heads, and his’en
on his face, such sights of it. But I don’t believe
they was very well off, for every one of ’em had broke
one eye off’en their spectacles, and they lifted up that
one eye, and looked at me through it, a laughin’ at
the same time as if they would split. But it didn’t
put me out a bit, I glared back at ’em, as sharp as
they did at me, and says I,</p>

<p>“Laugh away if you want to, I know what it is to
cook over a hot cook stove in the summer time, it tuckers
anybody out, even if they have got good help, and
I am sorry for Miss Aster.”</p>

<p>They snickered worse than ever, and I got mad, and
says I,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t wonder you laugh! there haint no more
pity and humanity in the whole lot on you, than there
is in a three tined pitchfork, and no wonder when you
see somebody that has got a little pity and generosity
into ’em, it is more of a amusement and novelty to you
than a circus would be.”</p>

<p>As I said this, I rose up in almost fearful dignity,
and sailed away from the table up to my room.</p>

<p>As I opened the door I heard a dreadful curious
noise, a kind of a gurglin’ gushin’ sound, and when I
opened the door, of all the freshets I ever see, I had
forgot to turn back the little screw, and the water was
a gushin’ out all over. Jonothen Beans’es ex wife,
happened to come along jest then, and she sent up a
nigger with a mop, and a lot of cloths, and I turned
to, and helped him, she told me not to, but says I,</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen’s wife haint one to shirk when there
is work to do,” and says I, “you tell Miss Aster, after
I get through here, I had jest as lives come down and
help her wash up the breakfast dishes as not,” says I,
lookin’ thoughtfully at my overskirt, “I don’t really
want to put my hands into the dish water on account
of my dress, but I had jest as lives wipe ’em as not.”</p>

<p>But J. Beans’es ex wife said there wasn’t no need
of my helpin’, and so after I got my room all slicked
up and my bed made (she told me to leave my bed,
but I wusn’t goin’ to act so slack) I sot down a minute
to rest, before I set sail in the cause of Right.</p>

<p>I was jest a thinkin’ that Betsey Bobbet was safe in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
the house of mournin’, and there was a sweet and
satisfied smile on my face, as I thought it, when all of
a sudden the door opened, and in she walked. My
heart sunk pretty near ½ an inch. But I ketched
holt of my principles, and says I,</p>

<p>“What is the matter Betsey?” For she looked as if
she had been cryin’ her eyes out. “Is your cousin no
more? has Ebineezah suicided himself?”</p>

<p>“No moah!” says she in a indignant tone. “She
is gettin’ well, and Ebineezah is as happy as a king
about it, she has been takin’ cod liveh oil, and “Cherry
Pectorial,” and they have cured her, I hate Cherry Pectorial,
and cod liveh oil, they are nasty stuffs.”</p>

<p>Says I, in a insinuatin’ tone, “you are goin’ back
there haint you?”</p>

<p>“No!” says she indignantly, “I won’t stir a step
back, they are so tickled about her gettin’ bettah, that
they don’t use me with no respect at all.” And there
was a tear in her eye as she added in sorrowful tones,
“Ebineezah told me that if it hadn’t been for that cod
liveh oil, he should have been a widowah, and a lonely
man to-day. No!” says she takin’ off her hat and
throwin’ it in a angry fierce way onto the bed, “I
won’t stir a step back, I won’t stay anotheh minute in
the same house with cod liver oil, I perfectly despise
it.”</p>

<p>I see there was no use a arguin’ with her, the arrow
had struck too deep, I see my fate, Betsey had got to
accompany me on my high and lofty mission. For a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
minute I thought wildly of escape, of gettin’ her out
of the room on some errent for a minute, and then tyin’
the sheets together and lowerin’ myself down from
the winder. But better feelin’s rose inside of me,
Betsey was a human bein’, I, belonged to the meetin’
house. All these nobler emotions tied up my tongue,
I said nothin’ but I turned and concluded the wild tumult
of my feelin’s, by takin’ the gingham case off’en
my umberell I was goin’ to carry with me, and puttin’
on my bunnet we started out for our promenade.</p>

<h2 id="MEET_DR_MARY_WALKER">MEET DR. MARY WALKER.</h2>

<p>No cambric needle ever had its eye sot any keener
and firmer onto the North pole, than Josiah Allen’s
wife had her keen gray eye aimed at the good of the
Human Race, so I thought I would go and see
Horace first. But Jonothan Beans’es ex-wife told
me he had gone away for the day, to some great rally
in a neighborin’ village. I didn’t have the least idee
what she meant by “rally,” but I answered her in a
bland way that “I hoped he would have good luck
and get quite a mess of it,” and then says I, “It won’t
make a mite of difference with me, I can go to Miss
Woodhulls’es first.”</p>

<p>Betsey was rampent to go to the Theater, “Barnums
Amusement,” and the “Centre of the Park,”
and some of the meetin’ houses with big steeples,
and other places of amusement. But I says to her
as we wended our way on, “Betsey, these old bones
of mine will repose in Jonesville to-morrer night, as
the poet saith, ‘In my own delightful feather bed.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
And Betsey, they couldn’t rest there, if they looked
back and see that they didn’t do all they could while
here, for the advancement of the Race, and for improvin’
of my own mind.” Says I, “I didn’t come to this
village for vain pleasure, I have got a high mission to
perform about, and a mind to improve upon.”</p>

<p>I thought we would jest run in a few minutes to
Miss Hookers’es, but her hired girl says to me at the
door says she,</p>

<p>“Miss Hooker is engaged.”</p>

<p>I looked the hired girl full in the face, and says I,</p>

<p>“What of it, what if she is?”</p>

<p>Then says the hired girl, “She hain’t to home.”</p>

<p>Says I, “Why didn’t you say so, in the first out,
and not go to beatin’ round the bush.” Says I, for
I was determined to do all the good I could to the
Human Race, “Miss Hooker is a first rate woman,
and it haint a hired girl’s place to talk about her
mistress’es family matters and love affairs.”</p>

<p>When we got to Miss Woodhulls’es we went up
the front doorsteps, and I knocked to the door, Betsey
says, “Ring the bell.”</p>

<p>Well says I, “I hain’t particuler, hand it along.”
I thought mebby she had got one in her pocket, and
wanted me to ring it to pass away the time, while we
was standin’ on the doorstep a waitin’ for Miss Woodhull
to come and open the door.</p>

<p>But Betsey reached by me, and took holt of a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
silver nub, by the side of the door, put there for a
orniment, and pulled it.</p>

<p>Says I, “Don’t be so impatient Betsey. She’ll be
here in a minute, don’t go to foolin’ and tearin’ the
house down to pass away time.”</p>

<p>Jest at that minute a little Black African came to
the door, he looked impudent at us, and says he,</p>

<p>“Miss Woodhull hain’t to home,” and he shet the
door right in our faces. We was jest goin’ down the
doorsteps, when the door opened agin, and a little
figger came out, that at the first view baffled me.
Says I to myself, “Is it a man, or is it a woman?”
It had a woman’s face but a man’s pantaloons. I was
baffled. But Josiah Allen’s wife hain’t one to give
up the ship while there is ½ a plank left. I was
determined to get all the knowledge I could while on
my tower. I was determined to get information on
every deep and mysterious subject I could. And so
I walked up to it, and says I in a low voice and polite
as I could, for fear of hurtin’ its feelin’s,</p>

<p>“Be you a man sir? or a women mom?”</p>

<p>It wasn’t mad a bit, (I say <em>it</em>, for I didn’t know
then in what gender to put it.) It looked me so
pleasant in the face, and yet so searchin’ly, that I was
kinder flustrated, and says I, in a kind of awe struck
tone,</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t be offended, I only ask for information.
Be you a masculine, femenine or neutral
gender?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>It smiled agin, jest as pleasant as one of my glass
jars of maple sugar, and then it opened its mouth and
said,</p>

<p>“I am Dr. Mary Walker.”</p>

<p>I don’t know when I have been so tickled; nothin’
is sweeter than knowledge to the inquirin’ mind,
when it has been baffled. Says I,</p>

<p>“Mary I am glad to see you,” and I give her
hand such a shakin’ that it looked red as a beet when
I leggo. Says I,</p>

<p>“I am gladder to see you than I would be to see
any nephew or neice I have got in the world. I am
as glad to see you as I would be to see any brother or
sister of mine.”</p>

<p>Says she, “I can’t recall your countenance.”</p>

<p>Says I, “Mary, I am Josiah Allen’s wife.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” says she, “I have read your eloquent orations
on wimmin’ havin’ a right. I am happy to
make your acquaintance.” Then and there I introduced
Betsey.</p>

<p>Says she, “Did you call to see Miss Woodhull?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says I, “I wanted to talk to her, for she is
in the wrong, but she haint to home.”</p>

<p>Says she, “she is to home, and you shall see her, a
few friends of the cause, have met here to-day, but
they are about all gone.” She went right up the
doorsteps agin, and instead of knockin’, she ketched
holt of that silver nob, that Betsey had been a foolin’
with. Mary was so excited that she didn’t really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
know what she was about, or else she would have
made some move towards gettin’ in to the house.
But it was jest as well, for that impudent faced little
Black African happened to come to the door agin jest
at the right time. And she spoke up kinder sharp
like,</p>

<p>“Show these ladies into the parlor, they are friends
of mine, and Miss Woodhull will be glad to see ’em.”</p>

<p>He looked as if he would sink, and I didn’t care if
he did, clear through to the suller. I should have
been glad to have seen him sunk.</p>

<p>I looked severe at him after I had gripped Mary’s
hand, and parted with her. He held the door open
awful polite, and in a kind of a apoligy way he murtered
somethin’ about,</p>

<p>“Sposin’ Miss Woodhull was engaged.”</p>

<p>Says I pretty sharp, “Sposin’ she is engaged, is that
any reason you should turn Betsey and me out
doors?” Says I, “I didn’t keep our folks’es doors
locked up when I got engaged to Josiah.” Says I,
“sposen’ Miss Woodhull is engaged, she ought to
have been engaged, and married, years ago.”</p>

<p>I was in the wrong, and I see it, and ketched holt
of my principles convulsively, for I see that my indignant
emotions towards that little lyin’ imp was a shakin’
’em. I hadn’t no right to be a speakin’ aginst the
woman of the house to their hired help. I felt as mean
as pusley to think I had done it, and says I, mildly,</p>

<p>“I am glad Miss Woodhull is engaged to be married,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
it takes a load off’en my mind,” says I, “I presume
she will settle doun and make a real likely woman.”</p>

<p>At that minute, a door opened right across the hall,
and a man come out and shet it agin, and he ketched
right holt of my arm, the first thing, and says he,</p>

<p>“Come, Marier Jane, or Marier Ann,” says he, “I
can’t really call to mind your precise name this minute,
but I think it is Marier any way, or mebby it is
Mary Ann. Come, Mary Ann, it is time to be a goin’
home.”</p>

<p>I looked at him with almost fearful dignity, and I
says to him with a air so cold that he must have
thought it blowed off of Greenland’s icy mountain,</p>

<p>“Leggo of my arm!”</p>

<p>But he never budged a inch, and I jest raised my
umberell, and says I, “If you don’t leggo of my arm,
I’ll make you leggo.”</p>

<p>Then he leggo. And he stood back a little, but he
looked piercin’ly and searchin’ly into my face, and
says he,</p>

<p>“You are my wife, haint you?”</p>

<p>Then again I spoke with that fearful dignity, and
that cold and icy air, 50 degrees under Mr. Zero it was,
if it was a degree.</p>

<p>“No Sir! I am proud and happy to say I am not
your wife, I am Josiah Allen’s wife.”</p>

<p>He looked real meachin’, and says he, “I beg your
pardon mom, but I’ve only been married to my last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
wife a few hours, havin’ got a divorce from a former
companion after dinner yesterday, and I have been so
busy since, that I haven’t really got the run of her face
yet, though I thought,” he added dreamily, “that I
should know that nose agin any where.”</p>

<p>I see that he was imposin’ on me. But I wasn’t
goin’ to have my nose throwed in my face by him,
and says I, “I am aware that my nose is a pretty sizeable
one. But,” says I, in about as sarcastic a voice
as I ever used in my life “it is a nose that haint never
been wore off, and made smaller a pokin’ into other
folks’es affairs. Pokin’ round a tryin’ to find wives
where there haint none.”</p>

<p>“But mom, I was married between daylight and
dark, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>But I wouldn’t stay to hear another word of his
apoligys, I jest turned my back onto him, when the
door opened agin, and a woman came out, and I’ll be
hanged if her nose didn’t look like mine&mdash;a honorable
Roman. The man looked at her in a kind of a undecided
way, but she walked right up and took holt of
his arm, and he brightened up, and says he. “Are
you goin’ home now Mary Ann?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says she, “but my name haint Mary Ann,
it is Mehitable.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” said he, “I knew there was a M in it.”
And he walked off with her, with a proud and triumphant
mene.</p>

<h2 id="INTERVIEW_WITH_THEODORE_AND">INTERVIEW WITH THEODORE AND
VICTORY.</h2>

<p>The young black African opened the door and says
he, “Josiah Allen’s wife, and Betsey Bobbet, mom.”
He had asked us our names jest before he opened it.</p>

<p>Miss Woodhull was a standin’ pretty near the door,
a talkin’ with 3 wimmin as we went in. But she come
forward immediatly and put out her hand. I took it
in mine, and shook it a very little, mebby 3 or 4 times
back and forth. But she must have felt by that cool,
cautious shake, that I differed from her in her views,
and had come to give her a real talkin’ to.</p>

<p>One of the wimmen she was a talkin’ to, had jest
about as noble a lookin’ face as I ever see, with short
white curls a fallin’ all round it. The beholder could
see by the first glance onto that face, that she hadn’t
spent all the immortal energies of her soul in makin’
clover leaf tattin’, or in cuttin’ calico up into little
pieces, jest to sew ’em togather agin into blazin’ stars
and sunflower bedquilts. It was the face of an earnest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
noble woman, who had asked God what He wanted
her to do, and then hadn’t shirked out of doin’ it.
Who had gripped holt of life’s plough, and hadn’t
looked back because the furrows turned over pretty
hard, and the stumps was thick.</p>

<p>She knew by experience that there was never any
greensward so hard to break up, as old prejudices and
customs; and no stumps so hard to get round as the
ridicule and misconceptions of the world. What made
her face look so calm then, when she was doin’ all this
hard work? Because she knew she was makin’ a clearin’
right through the wilderness that in the future was
goin’ to blossom like a rose. She was givin’ her life
for others, and nobody ever did this since the days of
Jesus, but what somethin’ of his peace is wrote doun
on thier forwards. That is the way Elizabeth Cady
Stanton looked to me, as Miss Woodhull introduced
me and Betsey to her, and to the two other ladies with
her.</p>

<p>One of the other wimmen I fell in love with at first
sight, and I suppose I should have been jest so partial
to her if she had been as humbly as one of the Hotentots
in my old Olney’s Geography, and I’ll tell you
why, because she was the sister of H. W. Beecher.
As a general thing I don’t believe in settin’ folks up,
because they happen to have smart relations. In the
words of one of our sweetest and noblest writers, “Because
a man is born in a stable it don’t make him a
horse.” Not as a general thing, it don’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>But not once in 100 years does Nature turn out such
a man as H. W. B. It takes her longer than that to
get her ingregiences and materials togather to make
such a pure sweet nature, such a broad charity, and
such a intellect as his’en. Why, if the question had
been put to me before I was born, whether I would
be born his sister, or the twin sister of the queen of
England, I’d never give a second thought to Miss Victoria
Albert, not but what I respect the Widder Albert
deeply, I think she is a real nice woman. But I had
ruther be his sister than to be the sister of 21 or 22
other kings. For he is a king not make by the layin’
on of earthly hands, he is God’s own annointed, and
that is a royalty that can’t be upsot. So as I remarked
I s’pose Isabella Beecher Hooker would have looked
pretty good to me any way.</p>

<p>The other lady was smart and sensible lookin’, but
she was some like me, she won’t never be hung for
her beauty. This was Susan B. Anthony. Betsey
Bobbet sot down on a chair pretty nigh the door, but
I had considerable talk with Susan. The other two
was awful long discussin’ some question with Miss
Woodhull.</p>

<p>Susan said in the course of her remarks that “she
had made the ‘Cause of Wimmen’s Rights,’ her husband,
and was going to cleave to it till she died.”</p>

<p>I told her I was deeply interested in it, but I
couldn’t marry myself to it, because before gettin’ acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
with it, I had united myself to Josiah.</p>

<p>We had considerable reasonable and agreeable talk,
such as would be expected from two such minds
as mine and hern, and then the three ladies departed.
And Miss Woodhull came up to me agin kinder
friendly, and says she,</p>

<p>“I am glad to meet you Josiah Allen’s wife,” and
then she invited me to set down. As I turned round
to get a chair I see through a door into another room
where sot several other wimmen&mdash;some up to a table,
and all dreadful busy readin’ papers and writin’ letters.
They looked so business-like and earnest at thier
work, that I knew they could not have time to back-bite
thier neighbors, and I was glad to see it. As I
took my seat I see a awful handsome gentleman settin’
on a sofa&mdash;with long hair put back behind his ears,&mdash;that
I hadn’t ketched sight of before. It was Theodore
Tilton, and Miss Woodhull introduced him to Betsey
and me. He bowed to Betsey, but he came forward
and took my hand in his’en. I couldn’t refuse to
take it, but I looked up in his handsome face with a
look about two thirds admiration, and one of sorrow.
If the handsomest and best feathered out angel, had
fell right over the walls of heaven into our dooryard
at Jonesville, I couldn’t have give it a more piercin’,
and sort of pitiful look than I did him. I then
turned and silently put my umberell in the corner
and sot down. As I did so, Miss Woodhull remarked
to Mr. Tilton,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>“She is a Strong Wimmen’s Righter, she is one of

<p>“No, Victory; I haint one of you, I am Josiah
Allen’s wife.” Then I sithed. And says I, “Victory
you are in the right on it, and you are in
the wrong on it,” and says I, “I come clear from
Jonesville to try to set you right where you are
wrong.” Says I, almost overcome with emotion.
“You are younger than I Victory, and I want to talk
with you jest as friendly as if I was your mother in
law.”</p>

<p>Says she, “Where do you think I am in the right,
and where do you think I am in the wrong?”</p>

<p>Says I, “You are right in thinkin’ what a solemn
thing it is to bring up children as they ought to be.
What an awful thing it is to bring the little creeters
into the world without their votin’ on the subject at
all, and then neglect ’em, and abuse ’em, and make
their poor little days awful long in the world, and
then expect them to honor you for it. You are right
in your views of health, and wimmin’s votin’ and etcetery&mdash;but
you are wrong Victory, and I don’t want
you to get mad at me, for I say it with as friendly
feelin’s as if I was your mother in law,&mdash;you are
wrong in this free love business, you are wrong in
keepin’ house with two husbands at the same time.”</p>

<p>“Two husbands! it is false; I was divorced from
him, and my husband and I found him perishing in
the streets, and we took him home and took care of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
him ’till he died. Which would the Lord have
done Josiah Allen’s wife, passed by on the other
side, or took pity on him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what the Lord would have done Victory,
but I believe I should have sent him to a good
horsepittle or tarven, and hired him took care of. I
never could stand it to have another husband in the
same house with me and Josiah. It would seem so
kind o’ curious, somethin’ in the circus way. I never
could stand it never.”</p>

<p>“There have been a good many things Josiah
Allen’s wife that you have not been required to stand,
God and man united you to a good husband whom
you love. But in your happiness you shouldn’t forget
that some other woman has been less fortunate.
In your perfect happiness, and harmony&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh!” says I candidly, “I don’t say but what
Josiah and me have had our little spats Victory.
Josiah will go in his stockin’ feet considerable and&mdash;”</p>

<p>But she interrupted of me with her eyes a flashin’,</p>

<p>“What would you say to livin’ with a man that
forgot every day of his life that he was a man, and
sunk himself into a brute. Leaving his young wife
of a week for the society of the abandoned? What
would you say to abuse, that resulted in the birth of
a idiot child? Would you endure such a life?
Would you live with the animal that he had made
himself? I married a man, I never promised God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
nor man that I would love, honor and obey the wild
beast he changed into. I was free from him in the
sight of a pure God, long enough before the law freed
me.”</p>

<p>I let her have her say out, for Josiah Allen’s wife
is one to let every man or mouse tell thier principles
if they have got any. And if I was conversin’ with
the overseer of the bottomless pit, (I don’t want to
speak his name right out, bein’ a Methodist), I would
give him a chance to get up and relate his experience.
But as she stopped with her voice kinder choked up,
I laid my brown cotton glove gently onto her shoulder,
and says I,</p>

<p>“Hush up Victory,” says I “wimmen must submit
to some things, they can pray, and they can try to let
thier sorrows lift ’em nearer to heaven, makin’ angels
of ’em.”</p>

<p>Here Mr. Tilton spoke up and says he, “I don’t believe
in the angels exclusively, I don’t see why there
shouldn’t be he angels, as well as she ones.”</p>

<p>I was tickled, and I looked at him approvin’ly, and
says I,</p>

<p>“Theodore you are the first man with one exception
that I ever see that felt that way, and I respect
you for it.” Says I, “men as a general thing think
that wimmen have got to do up all the angel business
there is done. Men seem to get the idee that they
can do as they are a mind to and the Lord will wink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
at ’em. And there are lots of things that the world
thinks would be awful coarse in a woman, but is all
right in a man. But I don’t believe a man’s cigar
smoke smells any sweeter to the Lord than a woman’s
would. And I don’t believe a coarse low song, sounds
any sweeter and purer in the ears of angels, because
it is sung in a base voice instead of a sulfereno. I
never could see why men couldn’t do somethin’ in the
angel line themselves, as well as to put it all on to the
wimmen, when they have got everything else under
the sun to do. Not but what,” says I, “I am willen’
to do my part. I never was a shirk, and Josiah Allen
will tell you so, I am willin’ to do my share of the
angel business.” And says I, in a generous way, “I
would do it all, if I only had time. But I love to see
justice and reason. Nature feathers out geese and
ganders equally, or if there is any difference the gander’s
wings are the most foamin’ lookin’. Men’s shoulders
are made jest the same way that wimmen’s are;
feathers would look jest as well on ’em as on a woman,
they can cultivate wings with jest as little trouble.
What is the purest and whitest unseen feathers on a
livin’ angel’s hidden wing, Theodore and Victory?
They are purity, goodness, and patience, and men can
grow these unbeknown feathers jest as easy as a woman
can if they only set out.”</p>

<p>I had spoke real eloquent, and I knew it, but I felt
that I had been carried away slightly by my emotions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
from the mission I had come on&mdash;to try to convince
Miss Woodhull where she was wrong. And so after
a minutes silence, I broke out agin mildly, for I felt
that if I give way to anger or impatience my mission
was lost.</p>

<p>“Another thing you are wrong in Victory, is to
think you can be lawfully married without any minister
or justice of the peace. I knew that all you needed
was to have it set before you plain by some female
that wished you well; you are wrong in it Victory,
and I tell you so plain, and to show you that I am
your well wisher, I thought after I had convinced you
that you was in the wrong, I would make you this offer.
That if you and Col. Blood will go home with
Betsey and me, Elder Wesley Minkley shall marry
you right in my parlor, and it shan’t cost you a cent,
for I will pay him myself in dried apples.”</p>

<p>Says she, “I don’t want any ceremony, I want the
only tie to hold me to my husband to be love, the one
sacred tie.”</p>

<p>“Love is a first rate tie,” says I, mildly, holdin’ on
to my temper first rate, “upwards of 15 years ago, I
give one of the most remarkable proofs of it, that has
ever been seen in this country;” (and for a minute my
mind wandered off onto that old revery, <em>why</em> did I
love Josiah Allen?) But collectin’ my mind together
I spoke onwards, with firm and cast iron principle.
“Still, although I felt that sacred tie unitin’ Josiah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
and me in a double beau knot that couldn’t be untwisted,
the first time we met, still, if Elder Wesley Minkley
hadn’t united us at the alter&mdash;or mother’s parlor,
I should have felt dreadful floatin’ round in my mind.
It would have seemed too curious and onstiddy kinder,
as if Josiah and me was liable to fall all to pieces at
any time, and waver off in the air like two kites that
had broke loose from thier strings.” Says I, firmly,
“Thier would be a looseness to it, I couldn’t stand.”</p>

<p>She said I would get accustomed to it, and that
custom made many things seem holy that were unholy,
and many things sinful that were pure in the sight
of God.</p>

<p>But still I murmured with a sad look, but firm as
old Bunker Hill, “I couldn’t stand it, Victory, it would
seem too much like a circus.</p>

<p>“And then agin, Victory, you are in the wrong of
it about divorces. ‘What God has joined togather let
no man put asunder.’”</p>

<p>Says she, “Josiah Allen’s wife, if divorces were free
to-morrow, would you get one from Josiah?”</p>

<p>“Never!” says I, and my best dress most bust open
at the breast, (them biases always was took up a little
too snug) at the idee of partin’ from Josiah.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it that would hold you so fast to each
other that nothin’ but death could separate you? was
it the few words you said before the minister?”</p>

<p>“It was love, Victory! love, that wouldn’t let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
eat a mite, nor sleep a wink, if I couldn’t put my hand
onto Josiah Allen any time day or night.”</p>

<p>“Then,” says she, “why not give other good men
and women credit for bein’ actuated by the same sentiments?
Those that God has joined togather, no man
<em>can</em> put asunder. Those who are really married heart
and sole, would never separate, it would only correct
abuses, and separate those that man, and not God, had
joined togather.”</p>

<p>Says I, “Victory, is there any particular need of
folks lettin’ man join ’em togather, when God hasn’t?”
says I; “if folks was obleeged to marry, there would
be some sense in such talk,” says I, “they haint no
business to marry if they don’t love each other. All
sin brings its punishment, and them that commit the
crime aginst thier own sole, of marryin’ without love,
ought to be punished by unhappiness in thier domestic
relations, what else can they expect?” says I. “Marriage
is like baptism, now some folks say it is a savin’
audnence, I say nobody haint any right to be baptised
unless they are saved already. Nobody haint any business
to put on the outward form of marriage, if they
haint got the inward marriage of the spirit.”</p>

<p>“Some folks marry for a home,” says she.</p>

<p>“Wall, they haint no business to,” says I warmly.
“I had ruther live out doors under a umberell, all my
days.”</p>

<p>“Those are my sentiments exactly, Josiah Allen’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
wife. But you can’t deny that people are liable to be
decieved.”</p>

<p>“If they are such poor judges the first time, what
would hender ’em from bein’ decieved the next time,
and so on, ad infinitum, to the twentieth and thirtieth
time?” says I firmly. “Instead of folks bein’ tied together
looser, they ought to be tied as tight agin. If
folks knew they couldn’t marry agin, how many divorces
do you suppose there would be? No doubt
there are individual cases, where there is great wrong,
and great sufferin’. But we ought to look out for the
greatest good to the greatest number. And do you
realize, Victory, what a condition society would be in,
if divorces was absolutely free? The recklessness with
which new ties would be formed, the lovin’ wimmen’s
hearts that would be broken by desertion, the children
that would be homeless and uncared for. When a
fickle man or woman gets thier eyes onto somebody
they like better than they do thier own lawful pardners,
it is awful easy to think that man, and not God,
has jined ’em. But let folks once get the idee into
thier heads, that marriage is a solemn thing, and lasts
as long as thier lives do, and they can’t get away from
each other, they will be ten times as careful to live
peacible and happy with thier companions.” Says I,
“When a man realizes that he can if he wants to, start
up and marry a woman before breakfast, and get divorced
before dinner, and have a new one before supper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
time, it has a tendency to make him onstiddy and
worrysome.”</p>

<p>Says I, “Victory, men are dreadful tryin’ by spells,
do you suppose I have lived with one for upwards of
15 years, and hain’t found it out? But suppose a
mother deserts a child because he is wormy, and tears
his breeches. She brought him into the world, and
it is her duty to take care of him. Do you suppose
a store keeper ought to take back a pink calico dress,
after you have made it up, and washed it because the
color washes out of it, you ought to have tried it
before it was cut off. I married Josiah Allen with
both eyes open, I didn’t wear spectacles then, I
wasn’t starved to it nor thumbscrewed into it, and it
is my duty to make the best of him.”</p>

<p>Says she, “When a woman finds that her soul is
clogged and hampered, it is a duty she owes to her
higher nature to find relief.”</p>

<p>Says I, “When a woman has such feelin’s, instead
of leavin’ her lawful husband and goin’ round huntin’
up a affinitee, let her take a good thoroughwert puke.
Says I, in 9 and ½ cases out of 10, it is folkes’es
stomachs that are clogged up insted of their souls.
Says I, there is nothin’ like keepin’ the stomach in
good order to make the moral sentiments run good.
Now our Tirzah Ann, Josiah’s girl by his first wife,
I kinder mistrusted that she was fallin’ in love with&mdash;”
I almost said it right out Shakespeare Bobbet, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
I thought of Betsey, and turned it “with a little feller
that hadn’t hardly got out of his roundabouts, she
bein’ at the same time in pantalettes. Well I give
her a good thoroughwert puke, and it cured her, and
if his mother,” says I with a keen look onto Betsey,
as I thought of my night of troubles, “If his mother
had served him in the same way, it would have
saved some folks a good deal of sufferin’.”</p>

<p>I see that agin I was wanderin’ off’en the subject,
and I says in a deep solemn tone,</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in this divorcin’.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tilton spoke up for most the first time, and
says he, “I think you are wrong in your views of
divorce, Josiah Allen’s wife.”</p>

<p>I looked into his handsome face and my feelin’s
rose up strong I couldn’t throw ’em, they broke loose
and says I, in almost tremblin’ tones,</p>

<p>“It is you that are in the wrong on it, Theodore,”
says I, “Theodore, I have read your poetry when it
seemed as if I could ride right up to heaven on it,
though I weigh 200 and 10 pounds by the steelyards.
There is one piece by the name of “Life’s Victory.”
I haint much of a hand for poetry, but I read it for
the first time when I was sick, and it seemed as if it
carried me so near to heaven, that I almost begun to
feather out. And when I found out who the author
was, he seemed as near to me as Thomas Jefferson,
Josiah’s boy by his first wife. Theodore, I have kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
sight of you ever sense, jest as proud of you, as if you
was my own son-in-law, and when you went off into
this free love belief I felt bad.” I took out my white
25 cent handkerchif, for a tear came within I should
say half or three quarters of a inch from my eye-winkers.
I held my handkerchif in my hand, the tear come
nearer and nearer&mdash;he looked agitated&mdash;when up spoke
Miss Woodhull.</p>

<p>“It is perfectly right; I believe in free divorce, free
love, freedom in everything.”</p>

<p>I jest jammed my handkerchif back into my pocket,
for that tear jest turned round and traveled back to
where it come from. I thought I had used mildness
long enough, and I says to her in stern tones,</p>

<p>“Victory, can you look me straight in the spectacles,
and say that you think this abominable doctrine
of free love is right?”</p>

<p>“Yes mom, I can, I believe in perfect freedom.”</p>

<p>Says I, “That is what burglers and incendiarys
say,” says I, “that is the word murderers and Mormans
utter,” says I “that is the language of pirates,
Victory Woodhull.”</p>

<p>She pretty near quailed, and I proceeded on, “Victory,
there haint but one true liberty, and that is the
liberty of the Gospel, and it haint Gospel liberty to be
surrounded by a dozen husbands’es and ex-husbands’es,”
says I, “this marryin’ and partin’ every day or to, haint
accordin’ to Skripter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>Says she in a scornful tone, “What is skripter?”
If I had been her mother I would have spanked her
then and there. But I wasn’t, and I jest turned my
back to her, and says I, “Mr. Tilton you believe the
bible don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes mom, I do, but the bible justifies divorce.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says I, “for one cause, and no other, and
the Saviour says that whosoever marries a woman put
away for any but the bible cause, commits adultery,
and I don’t believe in adulteration, nor Josiah don’t
either. But,” says I, convulsivly, “You know a man
will part with a woman nowadays if the butter don’t
come quick, and she will part with him if he don’t
hang up the bootjack. Is that bible Theodore?”
Says I, “don’t the bible say that except for that one
reason, man and wife are married till death parts ’em.”
Says I, “is a lawyer in a frock coat, with a lot of papers
stickin’ out of his breast pocket, death?” Says I,
“tell me Theodore is he death?”</p>

<p>He looked convinced, and says he, “No mom, he
haint.”</p>

<p>“Well then, what business has that little snip of a
livin’ lawyer to go round tryin’ to make out he is
death? tell me?” says I almost wildly.</p>

<p>I see my emotions was almost carryin’ me off, and
I ketched holt of my dignity, and continued in deep
solemn tones, “True marriage is a sacred thing, and it is a solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
thing, it is as solemn as bein’ baptized. And if you
are baptized once in the way you ought to be, it is
enough. But the best way you can fix it, it is a solemn
thing Victory. To give your whole life and soul
into the keepin’ of somebody else. To place all your
hopes, and all your happiness in another human bein’
as a woman will. A true woman if she loves truly,
never gives half of her heart or three quarters, she
gives it all. She never asks how much shall I get
back in money and housen and finery? or whether
she could do better in another direction. No; True
Love is a river that runs onward askin’ no questions of
anybody, sweepin’ right on with a full heart. And
where does that river empty Theodore and Victory?”</p>

<p>They both looked as solemn as a protracted
meetin’, almost, as I looked at ’em, first one, then the
other, through my specs; but they didn’t reply.
Says I, in a deep solemn tone, “the name of the place
where that river emptys is Eternity.” Says I, “That
river of True Love as it flows through the world gets
riley sometimes, by the earthly mud on its banks.
Sometimes it gets mad and precipitates itself over
precipices, and sometimes it seemin’ly turns backward
a spell. But in its heart it knows where it
is bound for, it keeps on growin’ broader, and
deeper, and quieter like, and as it jines the ocian
it leaves all its mud on the banks, for God cleanses it,
and makes it pure as the pure waters it flows into.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>I felt real eloquent as I said this, and it seemed to
impress ’em as I wanted it to. They both of ’em
have got good faces. Though I didn’t like their
belief, I liked their looks. They looked sincere and
honest.</p>

<p>Agin I repeated, “Marriage is a solemn thing.”</p>

<p>I heard a deep sithe behind me, and a sorrowful
voice exclaimed,</p>

<p>“It is solemn then both ways, you say it is solemn
to marry, and I know”&mdash;here was another deep sithe
“I <em>know</em> it is solemn not to.” It was Betsey, she was
a thinkin’ of the Editer of the Augur, and of Ebineezer,
and of all the other dear gazelles, that lay cold and
lifeless in her buryin’ ground. I felt that I could not
comfort her, and I was silent. Miss Woodhull is a
well bread woman, and so to kinder notice Betsey,
and make talk with her, says she,</p>

<p>“I believe you are the author of these lines</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘If wimmen had a mice’s will,</div>
<div class="verse i1">They would arise and get a <em>bill</em>?’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Yes,” says Betsey, tryin’ to put on the true modesty
of jenieus look.</p>

<p>Miss Woodhull said “she had heard it sung to several
free love conventions.”</p>

<p>“How true it is,” says Betsey glancin’ towards Mr.
Tilton, “that deathless fame sometimes comes by reason
of what you feel in your heart haint the best part
of you. Now in this poem I speak hard of man, but
I didn’t feel it Miss Woodhull, I didn’t feel it at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
time, I wrote it jest for fame and to please Prof.
Gusheh. I love men,” says she, glancin’ at Mr. Tilton’s
handsome face, and hitchin’ her chair up closer
to his’en.</p>

<p>“I almost worship ’em.”</p>

<p>Theodore began to look uneasy, for Betsey had sot
down close by the side of him and says she,</p>

<p>“Did you ever read the soul stirrin’ lines that Miss
Woodhull refers to, I will rehearse them to you, and
also three others of 25 verses apiece which I have
wrote since on the same subject.”</p>

<p>I see a cold sweat begin to break on his white and
almost marble forward, and with a agitated move he
ketched out his watch and says he,</p>

<p>“I have a engagement.”</p>

<p>Says Betsey, beseechin’ly layin’ her hand on his
coat sleeve, “I can rehearse them in 26 or 27 minutes,
and oh how sweet your sympathy would be to me, let
me repeat them to you deah man.”</p>

<p>A haggard look crept into his handsome eyes, and
says he, wildly turnin’ ’em away, “It is a case of
life and death,” and he hurried to the door.</p>

<p>But Betsey started up and got ahead of him, she
got between him and the door, and says she, “I will
let you off about hearin’ the poetry&mdash;but oh! listen to
my otheh prayer.”</p>

<p>“I <em>won’t</em> listen to your prayer,” says he, firmly.</p>

<p>“In the name of the female wimmen of America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
who worship you so, pause, and heah my prayer.”</p>

<p>He paused deeply agitated, and says he. “In their
name I will hear you, what is your request Betsey
Bobbet?”</p>

<p>She clasped her hands in a devotional way, and with
as beseechin’ and almost heart meltin’ a look as a dog
will give to a bone held above its head, she murmured,</p>

<p>“A lock of youh haih deah man, that I may look at
it when the world looks hollow to me, a lock of youh
haih to make my life path easier to me.”</p>

<p>I turned my spectacles on which principle sot enthroned,
towards ’em, and listened in awful deep interest
to see how it would end. Would he yield or not?
He almost trembled. But finally he spoke.</p>

<p>“Never! Betsey Bobbet! never!” and he continued
in low, agitated tones, “I have got jest enough to
look well now.”</p>

<p>My heart throbbed proudly, to see him comin’ so
nobly through the hot furnace of temptation, without
bein’ scorched. To see him bein’ lifted up in the
moral steelyards, and found full weight to a notch.
But alas! Jest as small foxes will gnaw into a grape
vine, jest so will dangerous and almost loose principles
gnaw into a noble and upright nature unbeknown to
them.</p>

<p>Agin Betsey says in harrowin’ tones, at the same
time ketchin’ holt of his coat skirts wildly,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you can’t part with any more, give me one haih,
to make my life path smootheh.”</p>

<p>Alas! that my spectacles was ever bought to witness
the sad sight. For with a despairin’, agonized countenance
such as Lucifer, son of Mr. Mornin’ might
have wore as he fell doun, Theodore plucked a hair
out of his foretop, threw it at Betsey’s feet, and rushed
out doors. Betsey with a proud, haughty look, picked
it up, kissed it a few times, and put it into her port-money.</p>

<p>But I sithed.</p>

<p>I hadn’t no heart to say anything more to Victory.
I bid her farewell. But after we got out in the street,
I kept a sithin’.</p>

<h2 id="A_WIMMENS_RIGHTS_LECTURER">A WIMMEN’S RIGHTS’ LECTURER.</h2>

<p>As we wended our way back to Miss Asters’es to
dinner, Betsey said she guessed after all she would
go and take dinner to her cousin Ebeneezer’s, for her
Pa hadn’t give her much money. Says she,</p>

<p>“I hate to awfully. It is revoltin’ to all the fineh
feelings of my nature to take dinneh theah, afteh I
have been so&mdash;” she stopped suddenly, and then went
on agin. “But Pa didn’t make much this yeah, and
he didn’t give me much money, he nor Ma wouldn’t
have thought they could have paid my faih heah on
the cars, if they hadn’t thought certain, that Ebeneezah’s
wife would be took from us, and I&mdash;should do my
duty by coming. So I guess I will go theah and get
dinneh.”</p>

<p>Thinks’es I to myself, “If your folks had brought
you up to emanual labor, if they had brought you up
to any other trade only to get married, you might
have money enough of your own to buy one dinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
independent, without dependin’ on some man to earn
it for you.” But I didn’t say nothin’, but proceeded
onwards to the tavern where I put up. When I got
there I met Johnothan Beans’es ex wife, and says she,</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot, there is a lady here that wanted to
see you when you got back.”</p>

<p>“Who is it,” says I.</p>

<p>“It is a female lecturer on wimmen’s rights,”
says she.</p>

<p>Well, says I, “Principle before vittles, is my theme,
fetch her on.”</p>

<p>Says she, “Go into your room and I’ll tell her you
have come, and bring her there. She is awful anxious
to see you.”</p>

<p>Well, says I, “I’m visible to the naked eye, she
won’t have to take a telescope,” and in this calm state
of mind I went into my room and waited for her.</p>

<p>Pretty soon she came in.</p>

<p>Jonothan Beans’es ex wife introduced us, and then
went out. I rose up and took holt of her hand, but
I give it a sort of a catious shake, for I didn’t like
her looks. Of all the painted, and frizzled, and
ruffled, and humped up, and laced down critters I
ever see, she was the cap sheaf. She had a hump on
her back bigger than any camel’s I ever see to a
managery, and no three wimmen ever grew the hair
that critter had piled on to her head.</p>

<p>I see she was dissapointed in my looks. She looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
dreadful kinder scornful down onto my plain alpaca,
which was made of a sensible length. Hers hung
down on the carpet. I’ll bet there was more’n a
bushel basket of puckers and ruffles that trailed down
on to the floor behind her, besides all there was on the
skirt and waist.</p>

<p>She never said a word about my dress, but I see
she looked awful scornful on to it. But she went on
to talk about Wimmen’s Rights, and I see she was
one of the wild eyed ones, that don’t use no reason.
I see here was another chance for me to do good&mdash;to
act up to principle. And as she give another humiliatin’
look onto my dress, I become fully determined
in my own mind, that I wouldn’t shirk out from doin’
my duty by her, and tell her jest what I thought of
her looks. She said she had just returned from a
lecturin’ tower out in the Western States, and that
she had addressed a great many audiences, and had
come pretty near gettin’ a Wimmen’s Rights Governor
chosen in one of the States. She got to kinder
preachin’ after a while, and stood lookin’ up towards
the cealin’, and her hands stretched out as if she was
a lecturin’. Says she,</p>

<p>“Tyrant man shan’t never rule us.” Says I, “I
haint no objection to your makin’ tyrant man better,
if you can&mdash;there is a chance for improvement in
’em&mdash;but while we are handlin’ ‘motes,’ sister, let us
remember that we have got considerable to do in the
line of ‘beams.’” Says I, “To see a lot of immortal
wimmen together, sometimes, you would think the
Lord had forgot to put any brains into their heads,
but had filled it all up with dress patterns, and gossip,
and beaux, and tattan.”</p>

<p>“Tyrant man has encouraged this weakness of
intellect. He has for ages made woman a plaything;
a doll; a menial slave. He has encouraged her weakness
of comprehension, because it flattered his self
love and vanity, to be looked up to as a superior
bein’. He has enjoyed her foolishness.”</p>

<p>“No doubt there is some truth in what you say,
sister, but them days are past. A modest, intelligent
woman is respected and admired now, more than a
fool. It is so in London and New York village,
and,” says I with some modesty, “it is so in
Jonesville.”</p>

<p>“Tyrant man,” begun the woman agin. “Tyrant
man thinks that wimmen are weak, slavish idiots, that
don’t know enough to vote. But them tyrants will
find themselves mistaken.”</p>

<p>The thought that Josiah was a man, came to me
then as it never had before. And as she looked down
from the cealin’ a minute on to my dress with that
scornful mene, principle nerved me up to give her a
piece of my mind.</p>

<p>Says I, “No wonder men don’t think that we know
enough to vote when they see the way some wimmen
rig themselves out. Why says I, a bachelder that had
always kept house in a cave, that had read about both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
and hadn’t never seen neither, would as soon take you
for a dromedary as a woman.”</p>

<p>She turned round quicker’n lightnin’, and as she
did so, I see her hump plainer’n ever.</p>

<p>Says she, “Do you want to insult me?”</p>

<p>“No,” says I, “my intentions are honorable, mom.</p>

<p>“But,” says I, puttin’ the question plain to her,
“would you vote for a man, that had his pantaloons
made with trails
to ’em danglin’ on
the ground, and
his vest drawed in
to the bottom tight
enough to cut him
into, and his coat
tails humped out
with a bustle, and
somebody else’s
hair pinned on the
back of his head?
Would you?” says
I solemnly fixin’
my spectacles
keenly onto her
face. “Much as I
respect and honor Horace Greeley, if that pure-minded
and noble man should rig himself out with a
bustle and trailin’ pantaloons, I wouldn’t vote for him,
and Josiah shouldn’t neither.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>But she went right on without mindin’ me&mdash;“Man
has always tried to dwarf our intellects; cramp our
souls. The sore female heart pants for freedom. It
is sore! and it pants.”</p>

<p>Her eyes was rolled up in her head, and she had
lifted both hands in a eloquent way, as she said this,
and I had a fair view of her waist, it wasn’t much
bigger than a pipe’s tail. And I says to her in a low,
friendly tone. “Seein’ we are only females present,
let me ask you in a almost motherly way, when your
heart felt sore and pantin’ did you ever loosen your
cosset strings? Why,” says I, “no wonder your
heart feels sore, no wonder it pants, the only wonder
is, that it don’t get discouraged and stop beatin’ at all.”</p>

<p>She wanted to waive off the subject, I knew, for
she rolled up her eyes higher than ever, and agin she
began “Tyrant man”&mdash;</p>

<p>Agin I thought of Josiah, and agin I interrupted
her by sayin’ “Men haint the worst critters in the
world, they are as generous and charitable agin, as
wimmen are, as a general thing.”</p>

<p>“Then what do you want wimmen to vote for, if
you think so?”</p>

<p>“Because I want justice done to every human
bein’. Justice never hurt nobody yet, and rights
given through courtesy and kindness, haint so good
in the long run, as rights given by law. And besides,
there are exceptions to every rule. There are mean
men in the world as well as good ones. Justice to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
wimmen won’t prevent charitable men from bein’
charitable, generous men from bein’ generous, and
good men from bein’ good, while it will restrain
selfishness and tyrany. One class was never at the
mercy of another, in any respect, without that
power bein’ abused in some instances. Wimmen
havin’ the right to vote haint a goin’ to turn the
world over to once, and make black, white, in a
minute, not by no means. But I sincerely believe
it will bring a greater good to the female race and
to the world.”</p>

<p>Says I, in my most eloquent way, “There is a
star of hope a risin’ in the East for wimmen. Let
us foller on after it through the desert of the present
time, not with our dresses trailin’ down onto the
sandy ground, and our waists lookin’ like pismires,
and our hair frizzled out like maniacs. Let us go
with our own hair on our heads, soberly, decently,
and in order; let us behave ourselves in such a
sober, christian way, that we can respect ourselves,
and then men will respect us.”</p>

<p>“I thought,” says she, “that you was a pure Wimmen’s
Righter! I thought you took part with us
in our warfare with our foeman man! I thought
you was a firm friend to wimmen, but I find I am
mistaken.”</p>

<p class="caption">FEMALE STATESMANSHIP.</p>
</div>

<p>“I <em>am</em> a friend to wimmen,” says I, “and because
I am, I don’t want her to make a natural born fool
of herself. And I say agin, I don’t wonder sometimes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
that men don’t think that wimmen know
enough to vote, when they see ’em go on. If a
woman don’t know enough to make a dress so she
can draw a long breath in it, how is she goin’ to
take deep and broad views of public affairs? If
she puts 30 yards of calico into a dress, besides the
trimmin’s, how is she goin’ to preach acceptably on
political economy? If her face is covered with
paint, and her curls and frizzles all danglin’ down
onto her eyes, how can she look straight and keenly
into foreign nations and see our relations there? If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
a woman don’t know enough to keep her dress out
of the mud, how is she goin’ to steer the nation
through the mud puddle of politics? If a woman
humps herself out, and makes a camel of herself,
how is she goin’ through the eye of a needle?”</p>

<p>I said these last words in a real solemn camp meetin’
tone, but they seemed to mad her, for she started
right up and went out, and I didn’t care a cent if she
did, I had seen enough of her. She ketched her trail
in the door and tore off pretty nigh a yard of it, and
I didn’t cry about that, not a mite. I don’t like these
bold brazen faced wimmen that go a rantin’ round the
country, rigged out in that way, jest to make themselves
notorious. Thier names hadn’t ought to be
mentioned in the same day, with true earnest wimmen
who take thier reputations in thier hands, and give
thier lives to the cause of Right, goin’ ahead walkin’
afoot through the wilderness, cuttin’ down trees, and
diggin’ out stumps, makin’ a path for the car of Freedom,
that shall yet roll onward into Liberty.</p>

<p>As soon as she was gone, I went down and eat my
dinner, for I was hungry as a bear. At the dinner
table Jonothan Beans’es ex wife asked me “what I
would like for desert.”</p>

<p>I told her “I hadn’t turned my mind much that
way, for I hadn’t no idee of goin’ into the desert business,
I wouldn’t buy one any way, and I wouldn’t
take one as a gift if I had got to settle down, and live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
on it. But from what I had heard Thomas Jefferson
read about it, I thought the desert of Sarah was
about as roomy and raised as much sand to the acre
as any of ’em.”</p>

<p>Says she, turnin’ the subject, “will you have pie or
puddin’.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t see then, and I have thought about it lots
sense, I don’t see what started her off onto Gography
all of a sudden.</p>

<p>After dinner I thought I would rest a spell. My
talk with that female lecturer had tired me out. Principle
is dreadful tuckerin’ to any body, when you
make it a stiddy business. I had rather wash, any
time, than to go off on a tower of it as I was. So I
went to my room and sot down real comfortable.
But I hadn’t sot more’n a minute and a half, when
Betsey Bobbet came, and nothin’ to do, but I must go
to Stewarts’es store with her. I hung back at first,
but then I happened to think, if Alexander should
hear&mdash;as of course he would&mdash;that I had been to the
village and hadn’t been to his shop, he would have
reason to feel hurt. Alexander is a real likely man,
and I didn’t want to hurt his feelin’s, and it haint
my way to want to slight anybody. And then I had
a little tradin’ I wanted to do. So take it all together,
I finally told Betsey I would go with her.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="ALEXANDERS_STORE">ALEXANDER’S STORE.</h2>

<p>I had heard it was considerable of a store, but
good land! it was bigger than all the shops of
Jonesville put together, and 2 or 3 10 acre lots, and a
few meetin’ housen. But I wouldn’t have acted
skairt, if it had been as big as all Africa. I walked
in as cool as a cowcumber. We sot down pretty nigh
to the door and looked round a spell. Of all the
sights of folks there was a comin’ in all the time,
and shinin’ counters all down as fur as we could see,
and slick lookin’ fellers behind every one, and lots of
boys runnin’ round, that they called “Cash.” I says
to Betsey,</p>

<p>“What a large family of boys Mr. Cash’es folks
have got, and they must some of ’em be twins, they
seem to be about of a size.”</p>

<p>I was jest thinkin’ in a pityin way of their mother:
poor Mrs. Cash, and how many pantaloons she would
have to put new seats into, in slidin’ down hill time,
when Betsey says to me,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>“Josiah Allen’s wife, hadn’t you better be purchasing
your merchandise?” Says she, “I will
set here and rest ’till you get through, and as deah
Tuppah remarked, ‘study human nature.’” She didn’t
have no book as I could see to study out of, but I
didn’t make no remarks, Betsey is a curious critter,
anyway. I went up to the first counter&mdash;there was a
real slick lookin’ feller there, and I asked him in a
cool tone, “If Mr. Stewart took eggs, and what they
was a fetchin’ now?”</p>

<p>He said “Mr. Stewart don’t take eggs.”</p>

<p>“Well,” says I, “what does he give now for butter
in the pail?”</p>

<p>He said “Mr. Stewart don’t take butter.”</p>

<p>“Well,” says I, in a dignified way, “It haint no
matter, I only asked to see what they was a fetchin’
here. I haint got any with me, for I come on a
tower.” I then took a little roll out of my pocket,
and undone ’em. It was a pair of socks and a pair of
striped mittens. And I says to him in a cool, calm
way,</p>

<p>“How much is Mr. Stewart a payin’ for socks and
mittens now. I know they are kinder out of season
now, but there haint no danger but what Winter will
come, if you only wait long enough.”</p>

<p>He said “we don’t take em.”</p>

<p>I felt dissapointed, for I did want Alexander to
have ’em, they was knit so good. I was jest thinkin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
this over, when he spoke up agin, and says he, “we
don’t take barter of no kind.” I didn’t know really
what he meant, but I answered him in a blind way,
that it was jest as well as if they did, as fur as I was
concerned, for we hadn’t raised any barter that year,
it didn’t seem to be a good year for it, and then I
continued on&mdash;“Mebby Mr. Stewart would take these
socks and mittens for his own use.” Says I, “do you
know whether Alexander is well off for socks and
mittens or not?”</p>

<p class="caption">DON’T TAKE BARTER.</p>
</div>

<p>The clerk said “he guessed Mr. Stewart wasn’t
sufferin’ for ’em.”</p>

<p>“Well,” says I in a dignified way, “you can do as
you are a mind to about takin’ ’em, but they are
colored in a good indigo blue dye, they haint pusley
color, and they are knit on honor, jest as I knit
Josiah’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who is Josiah?” says the clerk.</p>

<p>Says I, a sort of blindly, “He is the husband of
Josiah Allen’s wife.”</p>

<p>I would’t say right out, that I was Josiah Allen’s
wife, because I wanted them socks and mittens to
stand on their own merits, or not at all. I wasn’t
goin’ to have ’em go, jest because one of the first
wimmen of the day knit ’em. Neither was I goin’ to
hang on, and tease him to take ’em. I never said
another word about his buyin’ ’em, only mentioned in
a careless way, that “the heels was run.” But he
didn’t seem to want ’em, and I jest folded ’em up,
and in a cool way put ’em into my pocket. I then
asked to look at his calicos, for I was pretty near
decided in my own mind to get a apron, for I wasn’t
goin’ to have him think that all my property lay in
that pair of socks and mittens.</p>

<p>He told me where to go to see the calicos, and
there was another clerk behind that counter. I didn’t
like his looks a bit, he was real uppish lookin’. But
I wasn’t goin’ to let him mistrust that I was put to
my stumps a bit. I walked up as collected lookin’ as
if I owned the whole caboodle of ’em, and New York
village, and Jonesville, and says I,</p>

<p>“I want to look at your calicos.”</p>

<p>“What prints will you look at?” says he, meanin’
to put on me.</p>

<p>Says I, “I don’t want to look at no Prince,” says I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
“I had ruther see a free born American citizen, than
all the foreign Princes you can bring out.” Says I,
“Americans make perfect fools of themselves in my
mind, a runnin’ after a parcel of boys, whose only
merit is, they happened to be born before thier
brothers and sisters was.” Says I, “If a baby is born
in a meetin’ house, it don’t make out that he is born a
preacher. A good smart American boy like Thomas
Jefferson, looks as good to me as any of your
Princes.” I said this in a noble, lofty tone, but after
a minute’s thought I went on,</p>

<p>“Though, if you have got a quantity of Princes
here, I had as lives see one of Victory’s boys, as
any of ’em. The widder Albert is a good housekeeper,
and a first-rate calculator, and a woman that
has got a Right. I set a good deal of store by the
widder Albert, I always thought I should like to get
acquainted with her, and visit back and forth, and
neighbor with her.”</p>

<p>I waited a minute, but he didn’t make no move
towards showin’ me any Prince. But, says he,</p>

<p>“What kind of calico do you want to look at?”</p>

<p>I thought he come off awful sudden from Princes
to calico, but I didn’t say nothin’. But I told him “I
would like to look at a chocklate colored ground
work, with a set flower on it.”</p>

<p>“Shan’t I show you a Dolly Varden,” says he.</p>

<p>I see plainly that he was a tryin’ to impose on me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
talkin’ about Princes and Dolly Varden, and says I
with dignity,</p>

<p>“If I want to make Miss Varden’s acquaintance, I
can, without askin’ you to introduce me. But,” I
continued coldly, “I don’t care about gettin’ acquainted
with Miss Varden, I have heard her name
talked over too much in the street. I am afraid she
haint a likely girl. I am afraid she haint such a girl
as I should want my Tirzah Ann to associate with.
Ever sense I started from Jonesville I have heard that
girl talked about. ‘There is Dolly Varden!’ and
‘Oh look at Dolly Varden!’ I have heard it I bet
more’n a hundred times sense I sot out. And it seems
to me that no modest girl would be traipsin’ all over
the country alone, for I never have heard a word
about old Mr. and Miss Varden, or any of the Varden
boys. Not that it is anything out of charicter to go off
on a tower. I am off on a tower myself,” says I, with
quite a good deal of dignity, “but it don’t look
well for a young girl like her, to be streamin’ round
alone. I wish I could see old Mr. and Miss Varden,
I would advise the old man and woman to keep
Dolly at home, if they have any regard for her good
name. Though I’m afraid,” I repeated, lookin’ at
him keenly over my specs, “I’m afraid it is too late
for me to interfere, I am afraid she haint a likely
girl.”</p>

<p>His face was jest as red as blood. But he tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
turn it off with a laugh. And he said somethin’
about her “bein’ the style,” and “bein’ gay,” or somethin’.
But I jest stopped him pretty quick. Says I,
givin’ him a awful searchin’ look,</p>

<p>“I think jest as much of Dolly as I do of her
most intimate
friends, male or
female.”</p>

<p class="caption">DOLLY VARDEN.</p>
</div>

<p>He pretended to
turn it off with a
laugh. But I
know a guilty conscience
when I see
it as quick as anybody.
I haint one
to break a bruised
reed more than
once into. And
my spectacles
beamed more
mildly onto him,
and I says to him in a kind but firm manner.</p>

<p>“Young man, if I was in your place, I would drop
Dolly Varden’s acquaintance.” Says I, “I advise you
for your own good, jest as I would Thomas Jefferson.”</p>

<p>“Who is Thomas Jefferson?” says he.</p>

<p>Says I, in a cautious tone, “He is Josiah Allen’s
child, by his first wife, and the own brother of Tirzah
Ann.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>I then laid my hand on a piece of choklate ground
calico, and says I, “This suits me pretty well, but I
have my doubts,” says I, examinin’ it closer through
my specs, “I mistrust it will fade some. What is
<em>your</em> opinion?” says I, speakin’ to a elegantly dressed
woman by my side, who stood there with her rich
silk dress a trailin’ down on the floor.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose this calico will wash mom?”</p>

<p>I was so busy a rubbin’ the calico to see if it was
firm cloth, that I never looked up in her face at all.
But when I asked her for the third time, and she
didn’t speak, I looked up in her face, and I haint
come so near faintin’ sence I was united to Josiah
Allen. <em>That woman’s head was off!</em></p>

<p>The clerk see that I was overcome by somethin’,
and says he, “what is the matter?”</p>

<p>I couldn’t speak, but I pinted with my forefinger
stiddy at that murdered woman. I guess I had
pinted at her pretty nigh half a minute, when I found
breath and says I, slowly turnin’ that extended finger
at him, in so burnin’ indignant a way, that if it had
been a spear, he would have hung dead on it.</p>

<p>“That is pretty doin’s in a Christian country!”</p>

<p>His face turned red as blood agin&mdash;and looked all
swelled up, he was so mortified. And he murmured
somethin’ about her “bein’ dumb,” or a “dummy”
or somethin’&mdash;but I interrupted him&mdash;and says I,</p>

<p>“I guess you would be dumb yourself if your
head was cut off.” Says I, in awful sarcastic tones,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>“It would be pretty apt to make any body dumb.”</p>

<p>Then he explaned it to me. That it was a wooden
figger, to hang thier dresses and mantillys on. And
I cooled down and told him I would take a yard and 3
quarters of the calico, enough for a honorable apron.</p>

<p>Says he, “We don’t sell by retail in this room.”</p>

<p>I give that clerk then a piece of my mind. I asked
him how many aprons he supposed Tirzah Ann and I
stood in need of? I asked him if he supposed we was
entirely destitute of aprons? And I asked him in a
awful sarcastic tone if he had a idee that Josiah and
Thomas Jefferson wore aprons? Says I, “any body
would think you did.” Says I, turnin’ away awful
dignified, “when I come agin I will come when Alexander
is in the store himself.”</p>

<p>I joined Betsey by the door, and says I, “Less go
on to once.”</p>

<p>“But,” says she, to me in a low mysterious voice;
“Josiah Allen’s wife, do you suppose they would
want to let me have a straw colored silk dress, and
take thier pay in poetry?”</p>

<p>Says I, “for the land’s sake Betsey, don’t try to sell
any poetry here. I am wore out. If they won’t take
any sacks and mittens, or good butter and eggs, I
know they won’t take poetry.”</p>

<p>She argued a spell with me, but I stood firm, for
I wouldn’t let her demean herself for nothin’. And
finally I got her to go on.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="A_HARROWIN_OPERATION">A HARROWIN’ OPERATION.</h2>

<p>All I could do and say, Betsey would keep a goin’
into one store after another, and I jest trailed
round with her ’till it was pitch dark. Finally after
arguin’ I got her headed towards her cousin’s.</p>

<p>It was as late as half past eight when I got back to
Miss Asters’es. As I went by the parlor door, I heard a
screechin’ melankoly hollerin’. Thinks’es I to myself,
“somebody’s hurt in there, some female I should
think, by the voice.” I thought at first I wouldn’t
interfere, as there was enough to take her part, for the
room seemed to be chuck full. So I was goin’ on up
to my room, when it come to my ears agin, louder
and more agonizin’ than ever. I couldn’t stand it.
As a female who was devoted to the cause of Right,
I felt that in the behalf of my sect I would see what
could be done. I kinder squeezed my way in, up
towards the sound, and pretty soon I got where I
could see her. Then I knew she was crazy.</p>

<p>She looked bad. Her dress seemed to be nice silk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
but it jest hung on to her shoulders, and she had
strung a lot of beads and things round her neck&mdash;you
know how such poor critters will rig themselves out&mdash;and
she had tore at her hair so she had got it all
streamin, down her neck. Her face was deathly
white, only in the middle of her cheeks there was a
feverish spot of fire red. Her eyes was rolled up in
her head. She looked real bad.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;" id="illus52">
<img src="images/illus52.jpg" width="375" height="375" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A HARROWIN’ SCENE.</p>
</div>

<p>She had got to the piano in some way, and there
she set a poundin’ it, and yellin’. Oh how harrowin’
it was to the nerves, it made my heart almost ache to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
see her. There was a good many nicely dressed
wimmen and men in the room and some of ’em
was leanin’ over the poor girl’s shoulders, a lookin’ at
her hands go, and some of them wimmen’s dresses
was hangin’ down off their shoulders, so that I
thought they must have been kinder strugglin’ with
the maniac and got ’em all pulled down and torn open,
and they looked most as crazy as she did.</p>

<p>The poor girl didn’t know a word she was sayin’ but
she kep’ a mutterin’ over somethin’ to herself in a
unknown tongue. There wasn’t no words to it. But
poor thing, she didn’t sense it. Some of the time she
would be a smilin’ to herself, and go on a mutterin’
kinder low, and then her worse fits seemed to come
on in spasms, and she would go to poundin’ the piano
and yellin’. And I see by the way her hands went
that she had got another infirmity too. I see she had
got Mr. Vitus’es dance. It was a sad sight indeed.</p>

<p>As I see the poor thing set there with her dress
most off of her, jest a hangin’ on her shoulders, right
there before so many men, I thought to myself, what
if was my Tirzah Ann there in that condition. But
one thing I know as long as Josiah Allen’s wife lived,
she wouldn’t go a wanderin’ round half naked, to be
a laughin’ stock to the community. I took it so right
to myself, I kep’ a thinkin’ so, what if it was our Tirzah
Ann, that there wasn’t hardly a dry eye in my head.
And I turned to a bystanter, standin’ by my side, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
says I to him in a voice almost choked down with
emotion,</p>

<p>“Has the poor thing been so long? Can’t she get
any help?”</p>

<p>Jest that minute she begun to screech and pound
louder and more harrowin’ than ever, and I says in
still more sorrowful accents, with my spectacles bent
pityin’ly on her,</p>

<p>“It seems to come on by spasms, don’t it?”</p>

<p>She kinder held up in her screechin’ then, and went
at her mutterin’ agin in that unknown tongue, and he
heard me, and says he,</p>

<p>“Beautiful! hain’t it?”</p>

<p>That madded me. I give that man a piece of my
mind. I told him plainly that it “was bad enough
to have such infirmities without bein’ made a public
circus of. And I didn’t have no opinion of anybody
that enjoyed such a scene and made fun of such poor
critters.”</p>

<p>He looked real pert, and said somethin’ about my
“not havin’ a ear for music.”</p>

<p>That madded me agin. And says I, “Young man,
tell me that I hain’t got any ears agin if you dare!”
and I ontied my bonnet strings, and lifted up the corner
of my head dress. Says I, “What do you call
that? If that hain’t a ear, what is it? And as for
music, I guess I know what music is, as well as anybody
in this village.” Says I, “you ought to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
Tirzah Ann sing jest between daylight and dark, if
you want to hear music.” Says I, “her organ is a good
soundin’ one everybody says. It ought to be, for we
turned off a good two year old colt, and one of our
best cows for it. And when she pulls out the tremblin’
stopple in front of it, and plays psalm tunes Sunday
nights jest before sundown, with the shadders
of the mornin’ glory vines a tremblin’ all over her, as
she sings old Corinth, and Hebron, I have seen Josiah
look at her and listen to her till he had to pull out his
red bandanna handkerchief and wipe his eyes.”</p>

<p>“Who is Josiah?” says he.</p>

<p>Says I, “It is Tirzah Ann’s father.” And I continued
goin’ on with my subject. “No medder lark
ever had a sweeter voice than our Tirzah Ann. And
when she sings about the ‘Sweet fields that stand
dressed in livin’ green,’ she sings it in such a way,
that you almost feel as if you had waded through the
‘swellin flood,’ and was standin’ in them heavenly
medders. Tell me I never heard music! Ask Whitfield
Minkley whether Tirzah Ann can sing Anna
Lowery or not, on week day evenin’s, and old Mr.
Robin Grey. Ask Whitfield Minkley, if you don’t
believe me. He is a minister’s only son, and he
hadn’t ought to lie.”</p>

<p>The little conceited feller’s face looked as red as a
beet. He was a poor lookin’ excuse any way, a uppish,
dandyfied lookin’ chap, with his moustache turned up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
at the corners, and twisted out like a waxed end. He
pretended to laugh, but he showed signs of mortification,
as plain as I ever see it. And he put up his
specs, and I’ll be hanged if he hadn’t broke one eye
off’en ’em, and looked at me through it. But I wasn’t
dawnted by him, not a bit. I didn’t care how close
he looked at me. Josiah Allen’s wife hain’t afraid
to be examined through a double barreled telescope.</p>

<p>Just then a good lookin’ man with long sensible
whiskers and moustache, hangin’ the way the Lord
meant ’em to, and who had come up while I was a
speakin’ this last&mdash;spoke to me and says he,</p>

<p>“I am like you madam, I like ballads better than I
do opera music for the parlor.”</p>

<p>I didn’t really know what he meant, but he looked
good and sensible lookin’ and so says I in a blind way,</p>

<p>“Yes like as not.”</p>

<p>Says he, “I am very partial to those old songs you
have mentioned.”</p>

<p>Says I “They can’t be bettered.”</p>

<p>Before I could say another word, that poor crazy
thing begun agin, to yell, and pound and screech,
and I says to him,</p>

<p>“Poor thing! couldn’t there be somethin’ done for
her? If her mind can’t be restored, can’t she get help
for Mr. Vitus’es dance?”</p>

<p>And then he explained it to me, he said she wasn’t
crazy, and didn’t have Mr. Vitus’es dance. He said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
she was a very fashionable young lady and it was a
opera she was singin’.</p>

<p>“A operation,” says I sithin’ “I should think as
much! I should think it was a operation! It is a
operation I don’t want to see or hear agin.” And
says I anxiously, “Is it as hard on everybody as it is
on her? Does everybody have the operation as hard
as she has got it?”</p>

<p>He kinder smiled, and turned it off by sayin’ “It
is the opera of <cite>Fra Diovole</cite>.”</p>

<p>“Brother Devel,” says the conceited little chap
with the waxed end moustache.</p>

<p>“‘The Operation of the&mdash;&mdash;’” on account of my
connection with the M. E. church, says I, “I will call
it David.” But they both knew what I meant. “The operation
of the&mdash;the David. I should think as much.”</p>

<p>And I don’t know as I was ever more thankful
than I was when I reflected how my pious M. E. parents
had taught me how to shun that place of awful
torment where the&mdash;&mdash;David makes it his home.
For a minute these feelin’s of thankfulness swallered
these other emotions almost down. But then as I
took another thought, it madded me to think that
likely folks should be tormented by it on earth.
And I says to the little feller with the waxed end
moustache,</p>

<p>“If that operation is one of the torments that the&mdash;&mdash;the
David keeps to torment the wicked with, it
is a burnin’ shame that it should be used beforehand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
here on earth, to torment other Christian folks with.”</p>

<p>I didn’t wait for him to answer, but I turned
round with a real lot of dignity, and sailed out of the
room. It was with a contented and happy feelin’ the
next mornin’ that I collected together my cap box,
and spectacle case, packed my satchel bag with my
barred muslin night cap and night gown, and put my
umberella into its gingham sheath (for it was a pleasant
mornin’) and set, as you may say, my face homewards.
I thought I would proceed right from Horace’s
to the depott, and not come back agin to Miss
Aster’ses. I paid my bill with a calm demeaner,
though it galled me to see ’em ask such a price.</p>

<p>Jonothan Beans’es ex wife seemed to hate to have
me go, she is one that don’t forget the days when she
first went to grass. I told her to tell Miss Aster just
how it was, that I felt as if I must go, for Josiah
would be expectin’ me. But I would love to stay
and get acquainted with her. But she had so much
on her hands, such a gang to cook for, that I knew
she didn’t have no time to visit with nobody. And I
told her to be sure and tell Miss Aster, that she
mustn’t feel particuler at all because we hadn’t visited
together&mdash;but she must pay me a visit jest the same.
Then I sent my best respects to Mr. Aster and the
boys, and then I set out. Jest by the front door I
met Betsey, and we both set sail for Horace’s.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="A_VISIT_TO_HORACE">A VISIT TO HORACE.</h2>

<p>It was with a beatin’ heart that I stood at the door
of the shop where Horace’es papers are made. And
though he haint printed ’em alone since he was run
up, as he did more formally, they told me I would be
apt to find him at his old office.</p>

<p>I was jest a goin’ to knock when a boy came out,
and says I,</p>

<p>“Bub, I want to see Horace.”</p>

<p>“Horace who?” says he.</p>

<p>“Horace Greeley,” says I.</p>

<p>“Wall,” says he, “I will take up your card.”</p>

<p>I see then that he was a tryin’ to empose upon me.
I haint naturally warlike, but I can stand up on my
dignity, straight as a cob when I set out. Says I,</p>

<p>“I’ll have you know that I am a member of the
Methodist meetin’ house.” Says I, warmly, “I don’t
know one card from another, and I’m glad I don’t.”
Says I, “I presume there are wimmin here in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
village, as old as I be, that set up to play cards till 9
or 10 o’clock at night. But thank fortin’ I haint one
of ’em.” Says I, “Young man, I detest card playin’,
it ends in gamblin’. Now,” says I firmly, “you
jest tell me where Horace is, or I’ll know the reason
why!”</p>

<p>He see I wasn’t to be trifled with, any more. He
muttered somethin’ about <em>his</em> not bearin’ the blame.
But he went up stairs, and we followed tight to his
heels, and the minute he opened the door we went in.
Horace hadn’t dressed up much, for I spose he didn’t
expect us. But if he had been dressed up in pink
silk throughout, it wouldn’t have made no difference
to my feelin’s as I ketched sight of that noble and
benign face, that peaceful innocent mouth, that high
forward, with the hair a curlin’ round the sides of it,
like thin white clouds curlin’ round the side of a
mountain in Ingun summer.</p>

<p>I use that figger of speech, because his face looked
on the mountain plan, firm, and grand and decided.
And I put in the Ingun summer, because you know
jest how a mountain will look standin’ a considerable
ways above you on the first of October&mdash;kind o’ mellow
and peaceful and benign. But you realize all the
time, that under all the green and shady growth
of its mosses and evergreens, it has been growin’
gradual but stiddy through the centuries. Under all
that viel of shinin’ blue gawze, wove out of mist one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
way, with a warp of sunshine, under all the mellow
colerin’ the time of the year has give it, there is a
good strong back bone of solid rock in the old mountain,
that couldn’t be broke by all the hammers in
creation.</p>

<p>That was jest my idee of his face, a mountain in
Indgun summer, facin’ the sunrise. Standin’ up so
high that it ketches a light on its forward before the
world below gets lit up. Firm, solid principles with
the edge took off of ’em, and kinder topped off with
the experiences, and gradual convictions and discoveries
of a noble life. And all softened down by the
calmness and quiet of the time of day, and the fall of
the year. That was the way Horace Greeley’s face
looked to me as I got a full view of it as he set to his
desk a writin’.</p>

<p>In the dead of night on my own peaceful goose
feather bed at home, I had made a speech all up in
my mind for that glorious occasion, when 2 firm and
true principled minds should meet&mdash;which was Horace’s
mind and mine. For though we conflict in some
things, the good of the Human Race is as dear as our
apples is, in our eyes. But at the first sight of that
noble face, my emotions got up and overpowered me
so, that I forgot every word of my speech, and all I
could say was, in thick tones of feelin’ and principle,</p>

<p>“Horace, I have come.”</p>

<p>His face grew almost black with fear and anger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
He sprang up, and waved me back with his right
hand and shouted to me,</p>

<p>“It is in vain madam! you are the 94th woman
who has been here to-day after office. Female lobsteress
depart! Get thee behind me Sa&mdash;female!”</p>

<p>Says I with deep emotion, “Horace you don’t know
me! I am not a female lobsteress! I am Josiah
Allen’s wife.”</p>

<p>He came forward and shook hands with me, and
says he, “I know you will excuse my vehemence,
when I tell you, I am almost devoured by office seekers!”
He cleared a path through the papers on the
floor to some chairs, but as we set down, he continued
in tremblin’ tones, for it seemed as if he couldn’t forget
his troubles,</p>

<p>“Foxes and woodchucks have holes, but a candidate
for the Presidency can’t find none small enough
to hide in. I <em>did</em>,” says he sithin deeply, “I <em>did</em>
have a few peaceful, happy hours in the suller of my
dwellin’ house;” he paused, overcome by sad recolections,
and says I, deeply sympathizin’ and interested,</p>

<p>“What broke it up Horace?”</p>

<p>“They found the out door suller way; so,” says he
sithin agin, “I lost that peaceful haven.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” says I, tryin’ to soothe his agitation,</p>

<p>“You’re one in a high, noble place, Horace.”</p>

<p>“Yes!” says he, “but it places anybody under a
very strong light&mdash;a very strong light. I have never
done anything out of the way sense I was first born,
but what I have seen it in the papers. I tore my
pantaloons once,” says he, gloomily, “in gettin’ over
the fence at the early age of 2 and a half, and I bit
my mother once at the age of 7 months a nursin’, I
could wish these two errors of my past to be forgotten
by the world and overlooked, but in vain. I am
taunted with ’em on every side. I never threw a boot
jack at a tom cat in the dead of the night, but what
my picture has been took in the act, I never swore a
oath to myself in the depths of my own stomach, but
what I have seen that unspoken oath in the papers. I
never jawed Mrs. Greeley about my shirt buttons,”
he continued, sadly, “in the depths of our secluded
chamber, but what it has been illustrated with notes.”</p>

<p>As he spoke of jawin’ about shirt buttons, I says to
myself, “How much! how much human nature is
alike in all men,” and I says aloud,</p>

<p>“How much you remind me of Josiah.”</p>

<p>“Of Josiah!” says he, and that name seemed to
make him remember himself, and to come nobly out
of his gloomy reflections. “Josiah, he is your husband!
Oh yes, Josiah Allen’s wife! I am glad to
meet you, for although I couldn’t comply with the
request your letter contained, yet it convinced me
that you are a sincere friend to the human race.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says I, “Horace, I am, and I want you to
consider my request over agin.”</p>

<p>But he interrupted me hurriedly, seemin’ to want
to turn my mind from that subject.</p>

<p>“What do you think of Fourier’s system, Josiah
Allen’s wife?” says he, lookin’ at me languidly over
his specks.</p>

<p>Says I, “I never see Mr. Fourier. How can I tell
you any thing about the old man’s health, whether his
system is all right, or whether he is enjoyin’ poor
health. Horace, I come to talk with you on more
important things.”</p>

<p>But he continued placidly, hopin’ to draw my mind
off,</p>

<p>“What do you think of Darwin’s idees?”</p>

<p>“Darwin who?” says I. “Darwin Gowdey? I don’t
know any other Darwin, and I never mistrusted that
he had any idees, he is most a natural fool.”</p>

<p>Says he, “about our descendin’ from a monkey?”</p>

<p>Says I, with dignity, “I don’t know how it is with
you, but I know that I couldn’t descend from a monkey,
never bein’ on one’s back in my whole life.”
Says I, “I never looked well in the saddle any way
bein’ so hefty. But,” says I, in a liberal way, “if you,
or anybody else wants to ride monkeys, you have the
privilege, but I never had no leanin’ that way.” And
agin, says I, in agitated tones, “you needn’t try to
take my mind oft’en the deep and momentous subject
on which it is sot, by talkin’ about ridin’ monkeys.
Horace I have come clear down here to the village on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
purpose to ask you to examine your platform, and see
if there hain’t no loose boards in it where some of the
citizens of the United States, such as wimmen can fall
through. Platforms, that are built over the deep
waters, ought to be sound, and every board ought to
be nailed down tight, so that nobody&mdash;not even the
smallest and weakest&mdash;can fall through and get drownded.”
Says I, “Your door step is most all good solid
timber, but I feel there is one old, mouldy, worm
eaten board that is loose in it.” And with emotion
renderin’ my voice weak as a cat, says I, “Horace, I
want you to examine your door step and lay down a
new board, and I will help you do it. I come a purpose
to.”</p>

<p>He see it was vain to turn the current of my
thoughts round, and says he in a decided way,</p>

<p>“You must have become aware of my views from
the contents of my letter. You got my letter?” says
he in a enquirin’ tone.</p>

<p>“Yes,” says I, “we have framed it and got a glass
over it, jest because it was your writin’, but there
seemed to be a mistake in it; it seemed to be wrote
to Josiah.”</p>

<p>Says he, “What did you make it out to be?”</p>

<p>Says I, “it seemed to run as follers&mdash;‘I don’t want
to purchase any more shoats.’</p>

<p>“Josiah did have a uncommon kind of pigs, and we
thought mebby you had heard that Josiah wanted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
sell you one, though it was a mistake, for he swapped
a couple with Deacon Gowdey for a yearlin’ heifer,
and he didn’t have no more left than he wanted to
keep over.”</p>

<p>He said we didn’t read it right. It read, ‘I don’t
approve of any wimmen’s votes.’ And says he, leanin’
back in his chair, “That is the ground I take, I don’t
believe in Wimmen’s Rights. I don’t see what rights
they want&mdash;more’n they have now.”</p>

<p>Then I dove right into the subject that was the
nearest to my heart (with the exception of Josiah) and
says I, “Horace, we want the right of equal pay for
equal laber. The right of not bein’ taxed without
representation. The right of not bein’ compelled, if
she is a rich woman, of lettin’ her property go to support
public men, who are makin’ laws that are ruinin’
them she loves best, such as givin’ licences to ruin
body and soul. The right to stand by the side of all
good and true soles in the nation, and tryin’ to
stop this evil spirit of intemperance and licentiousness
that is runnin’ rampant through the land. The right
to&mdash;”</p>

<p>I don’t know how much longer I should have gone
on, but in the noble forgetfulness of yourself that
always accompanies genius, I had riz up, and by an
unguarded wave of my right hand a wavin’ in eloquence
I tipped over my umberell. Horace picked it
up (he is a perfect gentleman at heart) and says he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
“Set down Josiah Allen’s wife, don’t fatigue yourself
too much.”</p>

<p>Rememberin’ myself, I sot down, and Horace,
pensively wipin’ his brow with his lead pencil, went
on to say,</p>

<p>“I admit there is some truth in what you say, Josiah
Allen’s wife. I admit, as a truthful man should, that
whatever wimmen has laid thier hands to, such as
churches, hospital work, foreign missionary work,
ragged schools, Sunday schools, charity balls and
fairs, and Good Templars, they have done more
than men in thier efforts and good influence. They
are more patient than men; they are not so strong,
but they are more persistent. When they once get a
plan in thier heads, they are awful to hold on&mdash;if they
can’t accomplish it in one way, they will take
another.”</p>

<p>Says I, “that is jest what Josiah says. He says, ‘I
always have my own way.’”</p>

<p>“I admit, that whenever wimmen have been admitted
in any public affairs, they have had a puryfyin’,
and softnin’ and enoblin’ influence. But I deny that
votin’ and havin’ a voice in public affairs is goin’ to
better the condition of either wimmen or the nation.”</p>

<p>Says I, “Horace, the old White House needs puryfyin’
more than any horsepittle or meetin’ house in
creation.” And says I, “Let wimmen lay to, and help
clean house.” Says I, “let her try her hand for one
year, and see what she can do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>Says Horace, goin’ on placidly with his own
thoughts, “It is not the change that would be wrought
in public affairs I dread, so much as the change in the
wimmen themselves, if they should mingle in the wild
vortex of political life. I have two daughters, and
rather than have them lose all thier delicacy, and enter
political life and mount the rostrum, I would lay them
in thier grave. I don’t believe,” says he, with great
decision, “I don’t believe in wimmen leadin’ off into
politics, and mountin’ the rostrum.”</p>

<p>I interupted him with a earnest tone; “you needn’t
twit me of that, no more Horace. I don’t want to
mount no rostrum. I had ruther give Josiah 20 curtain
lectures than to give half of one to the public,
there would be more solid satisfaction in it. But as
far as indelicacy is concerned, it is no more immodest
for a woman to lead off in politics than to lead off one
of your indecent German waltzes with a man.” Says
I, “you men think it hain’t indelicate for wimmen to
go with you to balls, and to theatres, and into the
wild vortex of the ocean a bathin’ with you&mdash;and to
post offices, and to fires, and fairs, and horse races,
and to church, and to heaven with you. But it is
awful to go and drop a little slip of white paper into
a box, once a year with you.”</p>

<p>Says Horace wavin’ off that idee, “Woman holds
in her arms a more powerful ballot than she can in
her hands. Let her mould her baby boy, so that in
the future his mother will vote through him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>Horace looked noble as he said this. His silver
mounted spectacles shone with pure feelin’ and principle.
“But,” says I, in a reasonable tone,</p>

<p>“How can wimmen mould children, if she haint
got any to mould? I haint got any of my own, and
lots of wimmen haint.” Says I, “such talk is unreasonable,
how can she go to mouldin’, when she
haint got the materials?”</p>

<p>“Let them influence thier husbands then,” says he,
“the influence of wimmen over men, is wonderful,
and they can in this way wield a almost sovereign
power. And they do in many instances exert this
indirect power in an eminent degree.”</p>

<p>Says I, finally, “I don’t believe in no underhand
proceedin’, I never did. The idee of wimmen bein’
underhand, and go to mouldin’ men on the sly, I don’t
believe in it.” Says I, “accordin’ to your own story
Horace, wimmen have a influence in politics now.”</p>

<p>“Wall&mdash;yes&mdash;a sort of a indirect influence in thier
families, as it were.”</p>

<p>Says I, “Horace can you look me straight in the
spectacles and deny that there is wimmen’s influence
in politics at Washington to-day?” Says I, “look at
them female lobsteresses there.” Says I, “one handsome,
brilliant, unprincipled bad woman will influence
14 common men where a modest humbly well wisher
of her sect will one.” And says I, warmly, for the
thought of these female lobsteresses always madded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
me&mdash;“I should be ashamed if I was in some of them
Senators’ places, makin’ laws about the Mormans.”</p>

<p>I see my deep principle was a floatin’ me off into a
subject where as a female I didn’t want to go, and so
I choked back the words I was about to utter which
was, “I had jest as lives jine a Morman, as to jine
one of them.” I choked it back, and struggled for
calmness, for I was excited. But I did say this,</p>

<p>“I think good wimmen ought to have a chance
with bad ones in political affairs. For there is more
good wimmen in the land than there is bad ones, but
now the bad ones have it all thier own way.”</p>

<p>Horace wiped his brow gently with his lead pencil,
and said in a thoughtful accent,</p>

<p>“There may be some truth in what you say Josiah
Allen’s wife. I confess I never looked at it in exactly
this light before.”</p>

<p>Says I, in a triumphant glad tone, “That is jest
what I told Josiah.” Says I, “Josiah, Horace is all
right, there never was a better meanin’ man on the
face of the earth than Horace is. All he wants is to
have some noble principled woman to set him right in
this one thing.”</p>

<p>I see in a minute that I had made a mistake. Men
hate to be dictated to by a woman, they hate to, like
a dog. I see by his lowery brow that I had put the
wrong foot forrerd. For the time bein’ the sage and
the philosifer sunk down in his nature, and the <em>man</em>
spoke in the usual manlike way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>“I say wimmen’s brains are too weak to grasp public
matters. They have remarkable intuitions I grant.
A woman’s insight or instinct or whatever you may
term it, will, I grant, fly over a mountain and discover
what is on the other side of it, while a man is gettin’
his gunpowder ready to make a tunnel through it.
But they are not logical, they have not the firm grasp
of mind, the clear comprehension requisite to a voter.”</p>

<p>Says I, “Horace, which has the firmest grasp&mdash;the
clearest comprehension, a earnest intellegent christian
woman, or a drunken Irishman?” Says I, “Understand
me Horace, I don’t ask which would sell thier
votes at the best lay, or vote the most times in one
day&mdash;I dare say the man would get ahead of the woman
in these respects, bein’ naturally more of a speculator&mdash;and
also bein’ in practice. You know practice
makes perfect. I don’t ask you this. But I ask you
and I want you to answer me Horace, which would
be in the best condition for votin’, Elizabeth Cady
Stanton gettin’ up off of her religious knees in the
mornin’ after family prayers, and walkin’&mdash;with the
Constitution in one hand and the Bible in the other&mdash;coolly
and sensibly to the pole, or Patrick oh Flanegan
comin’ out of a drunken wake, and staggerin’ up
against the pole with a whisky bottle in one hand and
a club in the other, when he didn’t know nothin’ in
the first place, and then had lost half or 3 quarters of
that, in the liquer some clear minded, logical man give
him, for votin’ a few dozen times for him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>At this question Horace quailed a very little. But
it was not the quail of a weak man, there was principle
in that quail, and a determination to argue to the
end, which is one of the charicterestics of that great
and good man. She that was Samantha Smith also
possesses some of this spirit.</p>

<p>“Set down, Josiah Allen’s wife and don’t fatigue
yourself too much,” says Horace, for almost carried
away by my emotions, I had riz’ up and stood on my
feet agin.</p>

<p>And he went on, “You put the case in a very
strong light Josiah Allen’s wife. That is one of the
peculiar weaknesses of your sect. You don’t possess
sufficient moderation. You exaggerate too much.”</p>

<p>Says I, “publishin’ a daily paper for 20 years, has a
tendency to make any man a good judge of exaggeration,
and if you see by my symptoms that I have
got it, I haint a goin’ to deny it. But you haint answered
my question yet Horace.”</p>

<p>Says he “Josiah Allen’s wife, my mind is firmly
made up on this subject. And nothin’ upon earth
will ever change it. I am fully convinced that
woman’s enterin’ into public duties would result in
makin’ her coarse and unfeminine, and make her lose
her love for home and husband. And then, suppose
she were eligible for public offices; imagine a lady
blacksmith! a lady constable! a lady president! it is
absurd, Josiah Allen’s wife.”</p>

<p>Says I, “Horace, you are too smart a man to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
up such poor arguments. You don’t see a little sickly,
literary, consumptive, broken backed blacksmith or
constable. Men choose the occupations most congenial,
and suitable for them, and wimmen would do
the same, anyway. Rosa Bonheur chooses to live out
doors half the time among cattle and horses, and I
presume she haint half so afraid of ’em as Mr. A.
Tennyson would be. I have heerd Thomas Jefferson
read about ’em both. I don’t suppose any woman
would be compelled to be made a constable of, though
if they was, I presume men would submit to be incarcerated
by ’em as quick as they would by a male man.</p>

<p>“As for the idee of a lady president, I don’t know
as it would be any more absurd than a lady queen.
Victory sets up pretty easy in her high chair, there
don’t seem to be anything very absurd about the Widder
Albert. You say public duties makes a woman
coarse, and forgetful of home and husband. Horace,
look for one minute at the Widder Albert. Where
will you find among your weak fashionable wimmen,
so lovin’ a wife, so devoted a mother? Where will
you find a bigger housefull of children, brought up
better than hern? She has had more public duties to
perform than goin’ once a year by the side of her husband,
and votin’ for Justice and Temperance. But
did these public duties, that she performed so well,
wean her from her husband?” Says I, “did they take
up her mind so that she didn’t almost break her heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
when he died?” says I, “Do you think a honest desire
to live a full life&mdash;to use every power that God
has given you&mdash;to do your very best for God and humanity,
do you think that this desire modestly and
consistently carried into action, will make a woman
coarse and unwomanly, any more than this present
fashionable education, to flirt and simper and catch a
rich husband?”</p>

<p>Says I, “You seem to think that votin’ is goin’ to
be such a weight onto a woman that it will drag her
right down from her home into public and political
affairs and leave her there. Such talk is simple, for
love and domestic happiness will be the other weight
to the steelyards, as long as the world stands, and
keep a woman’s heart and mind jest as straight as a
string. Votin’ haint a goin’ to spile any woman at
all, be she married, or be she single, and there is a
class at the mercy of the world, fightin’ its hard battle
alone&mdash;it will <em>help</em> them. The idee of its hurtin’ a
woman to know a little somethin’, is in my mind
awful simple. That was what the slaveholders said
about the black Africans&mdash;it would hurt ’em to know
too much. That is what Mr. Pope says to-day about
his church members. But I say that any belief, or
custom that relies on oppression and ignorance and
weakness to help it on in any degree, ought to be exploded
up. Beautiful weakness and simplicity, haint
my style at all in the line of wimmen. I have seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
beautiful simplicities before now, and they are always
affected, selfish critters, sly, underhanded, their minds
all took up with little petty gossip and plottin’s.
Why they can’t set a teacup on the table in a open-hearted
noble way. They have to plot on some
byway to get it there, unbeknown to somebody.
Their mouths have been drawed so into simpers, that
they couldn’t laugh a open generous laugh to save
their lives. Always havin’ some spear ready under
their soft mantilly, to sweetly spear some other woman
in the back. Horace, they haint my style.
Beautiful weakness and simplicity may do for one
evenin’ in a ball room. But it don’t wear well for all
the cares and emergencies that come in a life of from
40 to 50 years. Was George Washington’s mother
any the less a industrious equinomical and affectionate
wife and mother, because she took a interest in public
affairs?” And says I, with a lower and more modest
tone, “Is Josiah Allen’s wife on that account any the
less devoted to Josiah?”</p>

<p>He knew I was perfectly devoted to that man.
He set mewsin’ silently for a time seemin’ly on somethin’
I had said heretofore, and finally he spoke up.
“The case of Victory is very different. A crown
that descends on a hereditary head is a different thing.”</p>

<p>“So ’tis,” says I, “But the difference is on the
wrong side, for sposin’ it descends onto the head of a
hereditary fool&mdash;or a hereditary mean woman. If a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
woman was voted for it would be for goodness, or
some other good quality.”</p>

<p>Says Horace, wavin’ off that idee and pursuin’ after
his own thoughts, “Man is sometimes mistaken in
his honest beliefs, but Nature makes her laws unerringly.
Nature intended the male of every species to
take the preeminence. Nature designed man to be at
the head of all public affairs. Nature never makes
any mistakes.”</p>

<p>“Nature made queen bees Horace. Old Nature herself
clapped the crown on to ’em. You never heard
of king bees, did you? Industrious equinomical critters
the bees are too. The public duties of that female
don’t spile her, for where will you find house-work
done up slicker than hern? Where will you
find more stiddy, industrious, equinomical orderly
doin’s through a whole nation than she has in hern?
All her constituents up to work early in the mornin’,
home at night too, jest as stiddy as the night comes.
No foreign spys can come prowlin’ ’round her premises&mdash;speculators
on other folks’es honey haint encouraged,&mdash;tobacco
is obnoxious to ’em. Only one thing I
don’t approve of, if food is skurce, if the females don’t
get honey enough to last the whole hive, all winter,
they slaughter the male bees in the fall to save honey.
I don’t approve of it; but where will you find a great
nater that haint got its peculiar excentricities? This is
hern. She wants to dispose of the drones as they call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
the lazy husbands of the workin’ wimmen, and she
thinks killin’ is the easiest way to dispose of ’em. I
say plainly I don’t approve of it, it don’t seem exactly
right to kill a husband to save winterin’ him, it would
seem better to me to get divorces from ’em and set
’em up in business in a small way. But as I said,
where is there a nater that haint got a weakness?
<em>this</em> is hern. But aside from this where will you find
a better calculator than she is? No dashin’ female
lobsteresses pullin’ the wool over the eyes of <em>her</em>
Senators. No old men bees gaddin’ ’round evenin’s
when their confidin’ wives think they are a-bed
dreamin’ about their lawful pardners&mdash;no wildcatishness,
and smokin’ and drunkenness, and quarellin’ in
<em>her</em> Congress. You can’t impeach <em>her</em> administration
no how, for no clock work ever run smoother and
honester. In my opinion there has a great many
men set up in their high chairs that would have done
well to pattern after this Executive female.”</p>

<p>As I finished, flushed with several different emotions,
Horace rose up and grasped me by the hand,
and says almost warmly,</p>

<p>“I am glad to have met you, Josiah Allen’s wife,
you have presented the subject in a new, and eloquent
light. I admire eloquence wherever I meet it.”</p>

<p>The praise of this great, and good man was like
manny to an Isrealitess. My breast almost swelled
with proud and triumphant emotions. But even then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
in that blissful moment, I thought of Josiah, no rock
was ever firmer than my allegience to that man, I
withdrawed my hand gently from his’en, and I said
to him, with a beamin’ face,</p>

<p>“You grasped holt of my hand, Horace, with the
noblest and purest of feelin’s, but I don’t think Josiah
would like to have me shake hands so often with any
man.”</p>

<p>Says he, “I honor your sentiments, Josiah Allen’s
wife, I think you are a firm principled woman, and a
earnest, well wisher of your sect. But I do think you
are in a error, I honestly think so. The Creator
designed woman for a quiet, home life, it is there she
finds her greatest happiness and content. God gave
her jest those faculties that fit her for that life. God
never designed her to go rantin’ round in public,
preachin’ and lecturin’.”</p>

<p>Says I, “Horace, I agree with you in thinkin’
that home is the best place for most wimmen. But
you say that wimmen have great influence, and great
powers of perswasion, and why not use them powers
to win men’s soles, and to influence men in the cause
of Temperance and Justice, as well as to use ’em all
up in teasin’ thier husbands to buy ’em a summer
bunnet and a pair of earrings? And take such wimmen
as Anna Dickinson&mdash;what under the sun did the
Lord give her such powers of eloquence and perswasion
for, if He didn’t calculate to have her use ’em?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
Why you would say a human bein’ was a fool, that
would go to work and make a melodious piano, a calculatin’
to have it stand dumb forever, holdin’ back all
the music in it not lettin’ any of it come out to
chirk folks up, and make ’em better. When a man
makes a cheese press, he don’t expect to get music out
of it, it hain’t reasonable to expect a cheese press to
play Yankee Doodle, and old Hundred. I, myself,
wasn’t calculated for a preacher.</p>

<p>“I believe the Lord knows jest what He wants of his
creeters here below from the biggest to the littlest.
When He makes a grasshopper, He makes it loose
jinted, on purpose to jump. Would that grasshopper
be a fullfillin’ his mission and doin’ God’s will, if he
should draw his long legs up under him, and crawl
into a snail’s house and make a lame hermit of himself?”</p>

<p>Says Horace, in reasonable accents, “No, Josiah
Allen’s wife, no, he wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” says I, “likewise with birds, if the Lord
hadn’t wanted the sing to come out of thier throats,
He wouldn’t have put it into ’em. And when the
Lord has put eloquence, and inspiration, and enthusiasm
into a human sole, you can’t help it from breakin’
out. I say it is right for a woman to talk, if she has
got anything to say for God and humanity. I have
heard men and wimmen both, talk when they hadn’t
nothin’ to say, and it is jest as tiresome in a man, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
is in a woman in my opinion. Now I never had a
call to preach, or if I had, I didn’t hear it, only to
Josiah, I preach to him considerable, I have to. I
should feel dreadful curious a standin’ up in the desk,
and takin’ my text, I don’t deny it, but,” says I, in
deep tones, “if the Lord calls a woman to preach&mdash;let
her preach, Horace.”</p>

<p>“Paul says it is a shame for a woman to speak in
public,” says Horace.</p>

<p>Oh what a rush of idees flowed under my foretop
as Horace said this, but I spoke pretty calm, and
says I,</p>

<p>“I hain’t nothin’ aginst Mr. Paul, I think he is a
real likely old bachelder. But I put the words, and
example of Jesus before them of any man, be he married,
or be he single.”</p>

<p>“Men will quote Mr. Paul’s remarks concernin’ wimmen
not preachin’, and say he was inspired when he
said that, and I say to ’em, “how is it about folks not
marryin’, he speaks full as pinted about that?” “Oh!”
they say, “he wazzn’t inspired when he said that,”
and I say to ’em, “how can you tell&mdash;when a man is 18
or 19 hundred years older than you be&mdash;how can you
tell when he was inspired and when he wazzn’t, not
bein’ a neighbor of his’en.” And after all, Mr. Paul
didn’t seem to be so awful set on this subject, for he
went right on to tell how a woman’s head ought to be
fixed when she was a prayin’ and a prophecyin’. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
in my opinion, all that talk about wimmen was meant
for that church he was a writin’ to, for some reason
confined to that time, and don’t apply to this day, or
this village&mdash;and so with marryin’. When a man was
liable to have his head cut off any minute, or to be
eat up by lions, it wazzn’t convenient to marry and
leave a widder and a few orphans. That is my opinion,
other folks have thiern. But let folks quarell all
they have a mind to, as to whether Mr. Paul was
inspired when he wrote these things, or whether he
wazzn’t, this <em>we know</em>, that Jesus is a divine pattern
for us to follow, and He chose a woman to carry the
glad tidin’s of His resurrection to the bretheren.
There was one woman who received her commission
to preach right from the Almighty.</p>

<p>“How dare any man to try to tie up a woman’s
tongue, and keep her from speakin’ of Him, when she
was His most tender and faithful friend when He
was on earth. It was wimmen who brought little
children that He might bless ’em. Did He rebuke
’em for thus darin’ to speak to Him publicly? No;
but He rebuked the men who tried to stop ’em.</p>

<p>“It was a women who annointed His feet, wet ’em
with her tears, and wiped ’em with the hairs of her
head. It was very precious ointment&mdash;but none too
precious for Him she loved so. Some logical clear
minded men present, thought it was too costly to
waste on Him. And again Jesus rebuked ’em for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
troublin’ the woman. It was in comfortin’ a woman’s
lovin’ achin’ heart that Jesus wept. It was wimmen
that stood by the cross to the very last and who
stood by his grave weepin’, when even Joseph had
rolled a great stun aginst it and departed. And it
was wimmen who came to the grave agin in the
mornin’ while it was yet dark. And it was a woman
that He first revealed Himself to after He rose.
What if Mary had hung back, and refused to tell of
Him, and the glory she had seen. Would He have
been pleased? No; when God calls a woman to tell
of the wonders of His love and glory that He has revealed
to her out of the darkness of this life, in the
Lord’s name let her answer. But let her be certain
that it is the Lord that is callin’ her, there is lots of
preachers of both sects in my opinion that pretend
the Lord is a callin’ ’em, when it is nothin’ but their
own vanity and selfishness that is hollerin’ to ’em.”</p>

<p>For pretty near ½ or ¾ of a minute, Horace set
almost lost in deep thought, and when he broke out
agin it was on the old theme. He said “wedlock
was woman’s true spear. In the noble position of wife
and mother, there lay her greatest happiness, and her
only true spear.” He talked pretty near nine minutes,
I should think on this theme. And he talked
eloquent and grand, I will admit, and never did I see
spectacles shine with such pure fervor and sincerity
as his’en. It impressed me deeply. Says he in conclusion,
“Marriage is God’s own Institution. To be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
the wife of a good man, and the mother of his children,
ought to be a woman’s highest aim, and purest
happiness. Jest as it is man’s highest happiness to
have a woman entirely dependant on him. It rouses
his noblest and most generous impulses, it moves his
heart to do and dare and his arm to labor&mdash;to have a
gentle bein’ clingin’ to his manly strength.”</p>

<p>His eloquence so impressed me, that I had no words
to reply to him. And for the first time sense I had
begun to foller up the subject, my mind wavered back
and forth, as Bunker Hill monument might, in a eloquent
earthquake. I says to myself, “mebbe I am
mistaken, mebbe marriage is woman’s only true
spear.” I didn’t know what to say to him, my spectacles
wandered about the room, and happened to
light onto Betsey&mdash;(I had been so took up with my
mission to Horace that I had forgot to introduce her)
and as they lit, Horace, who saw I was deeply impressed,
repeated something about “clingin’” and I
says to him in a foolish and almost mechanical tone,</p>

<p>“Yes Horace, I have seen clingers, here is one.”</p>

<p>Betsey riz right up, and come forrerd, and made a
low curchy to him, and set down tight to him, and
says she,</p>

<p>“Beloved and admired Mr. Horace Greeley, I am
Betsey Bobbet the poetess of Jonesville, and you
speak my sentiments exactly. I think, and I know
that wedlock is woman’s only true speah. I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
think wimmen ought to have any rights at all. I do
not think she ought to want any. I think it is real
sweet and genteel in her not to have any rights. I
think that to be the clinging, devoted wife of a noble
husband would be almost a heaven below. I do not
think she ought to have any other trade at all only
wedlock. I think she ought to be perfectly dependent
on men, and jest cling to them, and oh how sweet
it would be to be in that state. How happyfying to
males and to females that would be. I do not believe
in wimmen having their way in anything, or to set
up any beliefs of their own. For oh! how beautiful
and perfectly sweet a noble manly mind is. How I
do love your intellect, dearest Mr. Horace Greeley.
How is your wife’s health dear man? Haint I read in
the papers that her health was a failing? And if she
should drop off, should you think of entering again
into wedlock? and if you did, should you not prefer
a woman of genius, a poetess, to a woman of clay?”</p>

<p>Her breath give out here, and she paused. But oh
what a change had come over Horace’s noble and
benign face, as Betsey spoke. As she begun, his
head was thrown back, and a eloquent philosofical
expression set onto it. But gradually it had changed
to a expression of dread and almost anger, and as she
finished, his head sunk down onto his breast, and he
sithed. I pitied him, and I spoke up to Betsey, says
I, “I haint no more nor less than a clay woman, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
I know enough to know that no man can answer 25
or 26 questions to once. Give Horace time to find
and recover himself.”</p>

<p>Betsey took a bottle of hartshorn and a pair of
scissors, outen her pocket, and advanced onto him,
and says she in tender cooin’ tones. “Does your intellectual
head ache? Let me bathe that lofty forwerd.
And oh! dearest man, will you hear my one request
that I have dreampt of day and night, will you&mdash;will
you give me a lock of your noble hair?”</p>

<p>Horace rose up from his chair precipitately and
come close to me and sot down, bringin’ me between
him and Betsey, and then he says to her in a fearless
tone, “You can’t have a hair of my head, I haint
got much as you can see, but what little I have got
belongs to my wife, and to America. My wife’s
health is better, and in case of her droppin’ off, I
shouldn’t never marry agin, and it wouldn’t be a
poetess! though,” says he wipin’ his heated forwerd,</p>

<p>“I respect ’em as a Race.”</p>

<p>Betsey was mad. Says she to me, “I am a goin.
I will wait for you to the depott.” And before I
could say a word, she started off. As the door closed
I says in clear tones, “Horace, I have watched you for
years&mdash;a laberin’ for truth and justice and liftin’ up
the oppressed, I have realized what you have done
for the Black African. You have done more for that
Race than any other man in America, and I have respected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
you for it, as much as if I was a Black African
myself. But never! never did I respect you as I do
this minute.” Says I, “if every married man and
woman had your firm and almost cast iron principles,
there wouldn’t be such a call for powder and bullets
among married folks as there is now. You have riz
in my estimation 25 cents within the last 7 or 8
minutes.”</p>

<p>Horace was still almost lost in thought, and he
didn’t reply to me. He was a settin’ about half or 3
quarters of a yard from me, and I says to him mildly,</p>

<p>“Horace, it may be as well for you to go back now
to your former place of settin’, which was about 2 and
a half yards from me.” He complied with my request,
mechanically as it was. But he seemed still to be
almost lost in thought. Finally he spoke&mdash;as he wiped
the sweat off that had started out onto his eye brow&mdash;these
words,</p>

<p>“I am not afraid, nor ashamed to change my mind,
Josiah Allen’s wife, when I am honestly convinced
I have been in an error.” Says he, “It is cowards
only that cling outwardly to thier old mouldy beliefs,
for fear they shall be accused of being inconsistent
and fickle minded.”</p>

<p class="caption">FILLIN’ WOMAN’S SPEAH UNDER DIFFICULTIES.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>Says I, “That is just my opinion Horace! I have
been cheated by pickin’ out a calico dress in the evenin’.
Things look different by daylight, from what
they do by candle light. Old beliefs that have looked
first rate to you, may look different under the brighter
light of new discoveries. As you rise higher above
the earth you see stars you couldn’t ketch sight of in a
suller way. And the world’s cry of fickle mindedness,
may be the angels’ war whoop, settin’ us on to
heavenly warfare’.”</p>

<p>Horace seemed agin to be almost lost in thought,
and I waited respectfully, for him to find and recover
himself. Finally he spake,</p>

<p>“I have been sincere Josiah Allen’s wife, in thinkin’
that matrimony was woman’s only spear, but the
occurances of the past 25 or 30 minutes has convinced
me that wimmen may be too zealous a carryin’ out
that spear. I admit Josiah Allen’s wife, that any
new state of public affairs that would make woman
more independent of matrimony, less zealous, less
reckless in handlein’ that spear, might be more or
less beneficial both to herself, and to man.”</p>

<p>Here he paused and sithed. He thought of Betsey.
But I spoke right up in glad and triumphant tones,</p>

<p>“Horace, I am ready to depart this minute for
Jonesville. Now I can lay my head in peace upon
my goose feather pillow.”</p>

<p>I riz up in deep emotion, and Horace he riz up too.
It was a thrillin’ moment. At last he spoke in agitated
tones, for he thought still of what he had jest
passed through.</p>

<p>“My benefactor, I tremble to think what might
have happened had you not been present.” And he
ran his forefinger through his almost snowy hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p>“My kind preserver, I want to give you some little
token of my friendship at parting. Will you accept
as a slight token of my dethless gratitude, ‘What I
know about Farming,’ and two papers of lettice seed?”</p>

<p>I hung back, I thought of Josiah. But Horace
argued with me, says he, “I respect your constancy to
Josiah, but intellect&mdash;spoken or written&mdash;scorns all the
barriers of sex and circumstance, and is as free to all,
as the sunshine that beats down on the just and the
unjust, the Liberal Republicans and the Grant party,
or the married and the single.” Says he, “take the
book without any scruples, and as for the lettice seed,
I can recommend it, I think Josiah would relish it.”</p>

<p>Says I, “On them grounds I will accept of it, and
thank you.”</p>

<p>As we parted at the door, in the innocence of
conscious rectitude, we shook hands, and says I,
“Henceforth, Horace you will set up in a high chair in
my mind, higher than ever before. Of course, Josiah
sets first in my heart, and then his children, and then
a few relations on my side, and on his’en. But next
to them you will always set, for you have been
weighed in the steelyards, and have been found not
wantin’.”</p>

<p>He was to agitated to speak, I was awful agitated
too. Our silver mounted spectacles met each other
in a last glance of noble, firm principled sadness, and
so Horace and I parted away from each other.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="A_SEA_VOYAGE">A SEA VOYAGE.</h2>

<p>After I left Horace, I hastened on, for I was afraid
I was behind time. Bein’ a large hefty woman,
(my weight is 200 and 10 pounds by the steelyards
now) I could not hasten as in former days when I
weighed 100 pounds less. I was also encumbered
with my umberell, my satchel bag, my cap box and
“What I know about Farming.” But I hastened on
with what speed I might. But alas! my apprehensions
was too true, the cars had gone. What was to
be done? Betsey sat on her portmanty at the depott,
lookin’ so gloomy and depressted, that I knew that I
could not depend on her for sukker, I must rely onto
myself. There are minutes that try the sole, and
show what timber it is built of. Not one trace of the
wild storm of emotions that was ragin’ inside of me,
could be traced on my firm brow, as Betsey looked
up in a gloomy way and says,</p>

<p>“What are we going to do now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>No, I rose nobly to meet the occasion, and said in
a voice of marbel calm, “I don’t know Betsey.”
Then I sot down, for I was beat out. Betsey looked
wild, says she, “Josiah Allen’s wife I am sick of
earth, the cold heartless ground looks hollow to me.
I feel jest reckless enough to dare the briny deep.”
Says she, in a bold darin’ way,</p>

<p>“Less go home on the canal.”</p>

<p>The canal boat run right by our house, and though
at first I hung back in my mind, thinkin’ that Josiah
would never consent to have me face the danger of
the deep in the dead of the night, still the thought
of stayin’ in New York village another night made
me waver. And I thought to myself, if Josiah knew
jest how it was&mdash;the circumstances environin’ us all
round, and if he considered that my board bill would
cost 3 dollars more if I staid another night, I felt
that he would consent, though it seemed perilous,
and almost hazardous in us. So I wavered, and wavered,
Betsey see me waver, and took advantage of
it, and urged me almost warmly.</p>

<p>But I didn’t give my consent in a minute. I am
one that calmly weighs any great subject or undertakin’
in the ballances.</p>

<p>Says I, “Betsey have you considered the danger?”
Says I, “The shore we was born on, may sometimes
seem tame to us, but safety is there.” Says I, “more
freedom may be upon the deep waters, but it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
treacherous element. Says I, “I never, tempted its
perils in my life, only on a bridge.”</p>

<p>“Nor I neither,” says she. But she added in still
more despairin’ tones, “What do I care for danger?
What if it is a treacherous element? What have I got
to live for in this desert life? And then,” says she,
“the captain of a boat here, is mother’s cousin, he
would let us go cheap.”</p>

<p>Says I in awful deep tones of principle. “<em>I</em> have
got Josiah to live for&mdash;and the great cause of Right,
and the children. And I feel for their sakes that I
ought not to rush into danger.” But agin I thought
of my board bill, and agin I felt that Josiah would
give his consent for me to take the voyage.</p>

<p>Betsey had been to the village with her father on
the canal, and she knew the way, and suffice it to say,
as the sun descended into his gory bed in the west, its
last light shone onto Betsey and me, a settin’ in the
contracted cabin of the canal boat.</p>

<p>We were the only females on board, and if it
hadn’t been for Betsey’s bein’ his relation, we
couldn’t have embarked, for the bark was heavily laden.
The evening after we embarked, the boat sailin’
at the time under the pressure of 2 miles an hour,
a storm began to come up, I didn’t say nothin’, but I
wished I was a shore. The rain come down&mdash;the
thunder roared in the distance&mdash;the wind howled at
us, I felt sad. I thought of Josiah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>As the storm increased Betsey looked out of the
window, and says she,</p>

<p>“Josiah Allen’s wife we are surrounded by
dangers, one of the horses has got the heaves, can you
not heah him above the wild roah of the tempest?
And one of them is balky, I know it.” And liftin’
her gloomy eyes to the ceilin’ so I couldn’t see much
of ’em but the whites, says she, “Look at the stove-pipe!
see it sway in the storm, a little heavieh blast
will unhinge it. And what a night it would be for
pirates to be abroad, and give chase to us. But,”
she continued, “my soul is in unison with the wild
fury of the elements. I feel like warbling one of the
wild sea odes of old,” and she begun to sing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i2">“My name is Robert Kidd,</div>
<div class="verse i3">As I sailed, as I sailed.</div>
<div class="verse">My name is Robert Kidd, as I sailed.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She sung it right through; I should say by my feelin’s,
it took her nigh on to an hour, though my sufferin’s
I know blinded me, and made my calculations
of time less to be depended on than a clock. She
sang it through once, and then she began it agin, she
got as far the second time as this,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">As I sailed.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The cabin was dark, only lit by one kerosene lamp,
with a chimbly dark with the smoke of years. Her
voice was awful; the tune was awful; I stood it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
long as I could seemin’ly, and says I, in agitated
tones,</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t sing any more Betsey, if I was in your
place.”</p>

<p>Alas! better would it have been for my piece of
mind, had I let her sing. For although she stopped
the piece with a wild quaver that made me tremble,
she spoke right up, and says she,</p>

<p>“My soul seems mountin’ up and in sympathy with
the scene. My spirit is soarin’, and must have vent.
Josiah Allen’s wife have you any objections to my
writin’ a poem. I have got seven sheets of paper in
my portmanty.”</p>

<p>The spirit of my 4 fathers rose up in me and says
I, firmly,</p>

<p>“When I come onto the deep, I come expectin’ to
face trouble&mdash;I am prepared for it,” says I, “a few
verses more or less haint a goin’ to overthrow my
principles.”</p>

<p>She sot down by the table and began to take off
her tow curls and frizzles, I should think by a careless
estimate that there was a six quart pan full. And
then she went to untwistin’ her own hair, which was
done up at the back side of her head in a little nubbin
about as big as ½ a sweet walnut. Says she,</p>

<p>“I always let down my haih, and take out my teeth
when I write poetry, I feel moah free and soahing in
my mind.” Says she in a sort of a apoligy way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
“Genious is full of excentricities, that seem strange
to the world’s people.”</p>

<p>Says I, calmly “You can let down, and take out,
all you want to, I can stand it.”</p>

<p>But it was a fearful scene. It was a night never to
be forgot while memory sets up on her high chair in
my mind. Outside, the rain poured down, overhead
on deck, the wind shrieked at the bags and boxes,
threatenin’ ’em with almost an instant destruction.
The stove pipe that run up through the floor shook as
if every blast would unjinte it, and then the thought
would rise up, though I tried to put it out of my
head, who would put it up again. One of the horses
was balky, I knew, for I could hear the driver swear
at him. And every time he swore, I thought of
Josiah, and it kep’ him in my mind most all the time.
Yes, the storm almost raved outside, and inside, a still
more depressin’ and fearful sight to me&mdash;Betsey Bobbet
sot with her few locks streamin’ down over her
pale and holler cheeks, for her teeth was out, and she
wrote rapidly, and I knew, jest as well as I know my
name is Josiah Allen’s wife, that I had got to hear
’em read. Oh! the anguish of that night! I thought
of the happy people on shore, in thier safe and peaceful
feather beds, and then on the treacherous element
I was a ridin’ on, and then I thought of Josiah.
Sometimes mockin’ fancy would so mock at me that
I could almost fancy that I heard him snore. But no!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
cold reality told me that it was only the heavey horse,
or the wind a blowin’ through the stove pipe, and
then I would rouse up to the agonizin’ thought that I
was at sea, far, far from home and Josiah. And then
a solemn voice would sometimes make itself heard in
my sole, “Mebby you never will hear him snore agin.”
And then I would sithe heavily.</p>

<p>And the driver on the tow path would loudly curse
that dangerous animal and the wind would howl ’round
the boxes, and the stove pipe would rattle, and Betsey
would write poetry rapidly, and I knew I had got to
hear it. And so the tegus night wore away. Finally
at ½ past 2, wore out as I was with fateegue and
wakefullness, Betsey ceased writin’ and says she.</p>

<p>“It is done! I will read them to you.”</p>

<p>I sithed so deeply that even Betsey almost trembled,
and says she,</p>

<p>“Are you in pain, Josiah Allen’s wife?”</p>

<p>Says I, “only in my mind.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” says she, “It is indeed a fearful time.
But somehow my soul exults strangely in the perils
environing us. I feel like courtin’ and keepin’ company
with danger to-night. I feel as if I could almost
dare to mount that steed wildly careering along the
tow path, if I only had a side saddle. I feel like rushin’
into dangeh, I feel reckless to-night.”</p>

<p>Here the driver swore fearfully, and still more
apaulin’ sight to me, Betsey opened her paper and
commenced readin’:</p>

as she was a readin’ of ’em, I&mdash;a leanin’ back in my
chair&mdash;dropped off to sleep, and forgot my trouble.
Betsey also went to sleep before she read the last of
’em. And when I waked up, the boat had stopped
in front of our house, the wind had gone down, the
sun was a shinin’, and Josiah was comin’ down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
bank. The danger was all past&mdash;Home and Josiah
was mine agin. I grasped holt of his hand as he
helped me get off, and in a voice tremulous with feelin’s
I could not control I said,</p>

<p>“I have got home Josiah! is breakfast ready?”</p>

<p>There was a tenderness in his tone, and a happy
smile on his face that reminded me of the sweet days
of our courtship, as he answered me in a tone almost
husky with emotion,</p>

<p>“Yes Samantha, all but settin’ the table.”</p>

<h2 id="OLD_FRIENDS_IN_NEW_GARMENTS">OLD FRIENDS IN NEW GARMENTS.</h2>

<p>It was a lovely Monday forenoon some three or
four weeks after my voyage. I was a sittin’ near
the open back door enjoyin’ the pleasant prospect, and
also washin’ some new potatoes for dinner. Truly it
was a fair scene. The feathered hens was a singin’
in their innocent joy as they scratched the yieldin’
turf after bugs and worms. Old “Hail the Day” was
proudly struttin’ round, standin’ first on one foot and
then on the other, and crowin’ joyfully in his careless
freedom and glee. The breezes blew sweetly from
the west, and I thought with joy that my clothes on
the clothes line would be ready to iron by the time I
got dinner out of the way. The sun shone down out
of a blue and cloudless sky, and I looked pensively at
my green gages, and thought fondly how the sun was
a ripenin’ ’em. All nature was peaceful and serene,
and my mind as I gently scraped the large fair potatoes,
and thought how good they was goin’ to be with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
the baked lamb I had got in the oven, was as peaceful
and serene as the same. Suddenly I heard the gate
click to and I saw old Mr. Bobbet comin’ up to the
house. He seemed dreadfully agitated, and I could
hear him talkin’ to himself. He came right into the
door and took his hat off in one hand, holdin’ his
crooked cane in the other and swung ’em both over
his head to once, and says he,</p>

<p>“It’s done! It’s done!”</p>

<p>“What’s done,” says I droppin’ my knife onto the
floor.</p>

<p>“Betsey’s gone!” shouted he, and he run out the
door like a luny.</p>

<p>I was a most skairt to death, and remained motionless
nigh onto a minute, when I heard Josiah comin’
in. Little did I dream what a blow was comin’ onto
me. He come and stood right in front of me, and I
thought at the time, he looked at me dreadful curious,
but I kep’ on a scrapin’ my potatoes, (I had got ’em
most done.)</p>

<p>Finally all at once Josiah spoke up and says he,</p>

<p>“Betsey Bobbett is married.”</p>

<p>I dropped the pan of potatoes right down
onto the floor for I was as weak as a weak white cat.
“Who! Josiah Allen! who! is the man?”</p>

<p>“Simon Slimpsey,” says he, “They was married
last night&mdash;as I was comin’ by the old cider mill&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I see all through it,” says I mournfully. “He
and seven or eight of his children have been sick, and
Betsey would go and take care of ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” says Josiah, “As I was comin’ past the old
cider mill&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Says I with spirit, “It ought to be looked into.
He was a helpless old man, and she has took the advantage
of him.” I went on warmly, for I thought
of his gloomy fourbodin’s, and I always felt for the
oppressted and imposed upon. I had went on I presume
as much as 2 minutes and a ½ when Josiah
says he,</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t take on so about it Samantha, anybody
to hear you talk would think you was a perfect
farrago.”</p>

<p>Says I, “If I was a goin’ to abuse my wife and
call her names I would do it accordin’ to grammar,
you mean “virtigo” Josiah.”</p>

<p>“Wall I said virtigo, didn’t I?” Josiah never will
own that he is in the wrong.</p>

<p>“And I didn’t say you <em>was</em> a virtigo Samantha,
only anybody would take you for a virtigo, that
didn’t know you.”</p>

<p>I remained almost lost in sad thoughts for pretty
nigh ½ a minute, and then I says, in mournful tones,</p>

<p>“Have you heard any of the particulars Josiah?
Have you seen any of the relatives? was the old man
any more reconciled to the last?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says Josiah, “As I was comin’ by the old
cider mill&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wall do for conscience sake <em>come</em> by the old cider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
mill, and be done with it,” says I, feelin’ worried
out in my mind and by the side of myself.</p>

<p>“How be I goin’ to <em>get</em> by Samantha? you are so
agravatin’, you’ll never let me finish a story peacible,
and I should think it was about dinner time.”</p>

<p>“So ’tis,” says I, soothin’ly, hangin’ on the tea-kettle,
and puttin’ the potatoes over the stove in the summer
kitchen. For a long and arduous study of the sect
has convinced me that good vittles are more healin’
than oil to pour onto a man’s lacerated feelin’s. And
the same deep study has warned me <em>never</em> to get mad
at the same time Josiah does, on these 2 great philisofical
laws, hangs all the harmony of married life.
Then I stepped out onto the stoop agin, and says to
him in calm, affectionate accents,</p>

<p>“What is it about the old cider mill, Josiah?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’” says he, “Only I met one of the first
mourners&mdash;I mean one of old Slimpsey’s sisters there,
and she told me about it, she said that sense the
Editer of the Auger was married, and sense Betsey
had got back from New York she had acted like a
wild critter. She seemed to think it was now or never.
The awful doom of not bein’ married at all, seemed
to fall upon her, and craze her with wild horror.
And findin’ Slimpsey who was a weak sort of a man
any way, and doubly weakened now by age and inflamatory
rheumatism, she went and took care of him, and
got the upper hand of him, made him a victim and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
married him, at his own house, Sunday night at half
past seven.”</p>

<p>I was so lost in sorrowful thought as Josiah continued
the mournful tale, that Josiah says, in a soothin’ tone,</p>

<p>“You ought to try to be reconciled to it Samantha,
it seems to be the Lord’s will that she should marry
him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in layin’ every mean low lived
thing to the Lord, Josiah, I lay this to Betsey Bobbet;”
and I agin plunged down into gloomy thought, and
was roused only by his concludin’ words,</p>

<p>“Seems to me Samantha, you might have a few
griddle cakes, the bread&mdash;I see this mornin’&mdash;was
gettin’ kinder dry.”</p>

<p>Mechanically I complied with his request, for my
thoughts wasn’t there, they was with the afflicted, and
down trodden.</p>

<p>One week after this I was goin’ up the post office
steps, and I come face to face with Simon Slimpsey.
He had grown 23 years older durin’ the past week.
But he is a shiftless, harmless critter hurtin’ himself
more’n any body else. He was naturally a small
boned man. In the prime of his manhood he might
have come up to Betsey’s shoulders, but now withered
by age and grief the highest hat was futile to bring
him up much above her belt ribbon. He looked sad
indeed, my heart bled for him. But with the instinctive
delicacy inherient to my sect, I put on a jokeuler
tone, and says I, as I shook hands with him,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>“How do you do, Simon? I hain’t seen you before,
sense you was married, Simon Slimpsey.”</p>

<p>He looked at me almost wildly in the face, and says
he in a despairin’ tone,</p>

<p>“I knew it would come to this, Miss Allen! I knew
it. I told you how it would be, you know I did. She
always said it was her spear to marry, I knew I should
be the one, I always was the one.”</p>

<p>“Don’t she use you well, Simon Slimpsey?”</p>

<p>“She is pretty hard on me,” says he. “I hain’t had
my way in anything sense the day she married me.
She begun to ‘hold my nose to the grindstone,’ as the
saying is, before we had been married 2 hours. And
she hain’t no housekeeper, nor cook, I have had to live
on pancakes most of the time sense it took place, and
they are tougher than leather; I have been most
tempted to cut some out of my boot legs to see if they
wouldn’t be tenderer, but I never should hear the end
of it, if I did. She jaws me awfully, and orders me
round as if I was a dog, a yeller dog&mdash;” he added
despairin’ly, “if I was a yeller dog, she couldn’t seem
to look down on me any more, and treat me any
worse.”</p>

<p>Says I, “I always did mistrust these wimmen that
talk so much about not wantin’ any rights, and
clingin’ and so forth. But,” says I, not wantin’ to run
anybody to thier backs, “she thought it was her spear
to marry.”</p>

<p>“I told you,” says he, in agonizin’ tones, “I told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
you that spear of hern would destroy me, and it has.”</p>

<p>He looked so sorrowful that I says to him in still
more jokeuler tones than I had yet used, “Chirk up
Simon Slimpsey, I wish you joy.” I felt that he
needed it indeed. He give me an awful look that
was jest about half reproach, and half anguish, and I
see a tear begin to flow. I turned away respectin’ his
feelin’s. As he went down the steps slowly, I see
him put his hands in his pockets, as if searchin’ for
his handkerchief, seemin’ly in vain. But he had on a
long blue broadcloth swallow tailed coat that he was
married in the first time long years ago, and as he
went round the corner he took up the skirts of his
coat and wiped his eyes. I said to myself with a
deep sithe, “And this is woman’s only spear.”
And the words awakened in my breast as many as 19
or 20 different emotions, and I don’t know but more.</p>

<p>I murmured mewsin’ly to myself, “It seems to me,
if I was a woman I should about as lives be a constable.”</p>

<p>While I was still mewsin’, Betsey, his wife tore
down the street, in a distracted way, and paused
before me.</p>

<p>“Have you seen my husband?” says she, “can you
tell a distracted wife&mdash;have you seen her husband
Simon Slimpsey?”</p>

<p>She looked wild, as if she feared a catastrophe, and
she cried out, loosin’ holt of her self control, in a firm
constable like tone,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>“He shall not escape me! I will telegraph to the
next station house! I will have the creek dragged!
the woods shall be scoured out!” says she.</p>

<p>“Be calm, and compose yourself,” says I frigidly,
“Simon Slimpsey has gone up towards his house.”</p>

<p>She heaved a deep sithe of content, and triumph
agin brooded down upon her eye-brow as she follered
on after him.</p>

<p>I hadn’t no idee of callin’ on her, I wouldn’t, but
the next day, Simon Slimpsey went by on his old
white horse. It is a very dejected lookin’ horse in the
face, besides carryin’ a couple of wash-boards in its
sides, in the line of ribs. Thomas Jefferson says,
“What gives it its mournful expression, it is mournin’
for the companions of its youth.” Says he, “you
know Noah saved a pair of everything,” and says he,
“his poor companion passed away several thousand
years ago.” That boy worrys me, I don’t know what
he is comin’ to. Slimpsey’s old horse haint more’n
35 or 40 years old, I don’t believe. They say Betsey
is makin’ a pale blue cambric ridin’ dress, and is goin’
to ride him a horse back this fall. It don’t seem to
me there would be much fun in it, he is so lame,
besides havin’ a habit of fallin’ frequently with the
blind staggers; howsomever it’s none of my business.</p>

<p>But as I was a sayin’ I stood silently in the door,
to see old Slimpsey go by a horseback, and I thought
to myself as I pensively turned out my tea grounds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
(I was a gettin’ dinner) how much&mdash;how much it
looks like a night mare that has broke out of its lawful
night pastures, and is runnin’ away with a pale
and harassed victim. So haggard and melancholy
did they both look. And I sithed. I hadn’t much
more’n got through sithin’, when he rode up, and
says he,</p>

<p>“The seventh boy is worse, and the twin girls are
took down with it, it would be a melankoly pleasure
Miss Allen if you could go up.” I went.</p>

<p>Betsey had got the most of ’em to sleep, and was
settin’ between a few cradles, and trundle beds, and
high chairs all filled with measles, and a few mumps.
Betsey’s teeth was out, and her tow frizzles lay on
the table with a lot of paper&mdash;so I mistrusted she had
been writin’ a poem. But she was now engaged in
mendin’ a pair of pantaloons, the 8th pair&mdash;she told
me&mdash;she had mended that day, for Simon Slimpsy was
a poor man, and couldn’t afford to buy new ones.
They was a hard and mournful lookin’ pair, and says
I to her&mdash;in a tone in which pity and contempt was
blended about half and half&mdash;</p>

<p>“Betsey are you happy?”</p>

<p>“I am at rest,” says she, “more at rest than I have
been for years.”</p>

<p>“Are you happy?” says I, lookin’ keenly at her.</p>

<p>“I feel real dignified,” says she, “There isn’t no
use in a woman trying to be dignified till she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
married, for she can’t. I have tried it and I know.
I can truly say Josiah Allen’s wife, that I neveh
knew what dignity was, until one week ago last
Sunday night at half past seven in the evenin’,”
says she, turnin’ over the pantaloons, and attactin’ a
ghastly hole of about 7 by 9 dimensions in the left
knee.</p>

<p>I sot silently in my chair like a statute, while she
remarked thus, and as she paused, I says to her agin,
fixing my mild but stern grey eyes upon her weary
form, bendin’ over the dilapitated folds of the 8th.</p>

<p>“Are you happy Betsey?”</p>

<p>“I have got something to lean on,” says she.</p>

<p>I thought of the fragile form bendin’ over the lean
and haggard horse, and totterin’ away, withered by
age and grief, in the swallow tailed coat, and says I in
a pityin’ accent,</p>

<p>“Don’t lean too hard Betsey.”</p>

<p>“Why?” says she.</p>

<p>Says I, in a kind of a blind way, “You may be
sorry if you do,” and then I says to her in clear and
piercin’ accents these words,</p>

<p>“Do you love your husband Betsey?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think love is necessary,” says she, “I am
married, which is enough to satisfy any woman who
is more or less reasonable, that is the main and important
thing, and as I have said, love and respect,
and so forth are miners as&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>“Miners!” says I in a tone of deep indignity,
“Miners! Betsey Bobbet&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mrs Betsey Bobbet Slimpsey,” says she correctin’
of me proudly, as she attacted another mournful lookin’
hole as big as my two hands,</p>

<p>“Well! Betsey Slimpsey!” says I, beginnin’ agin,
and wavin’ my right hand in a eloquent wave, “There
hain’t no more beautiful sight on earth than to see
two hunan soles, out of pure love to each other, gently
approachin’ each other, as if they must. And at
last all thier hopes and thoughts, and affections runnin’
in together, so you can’t seperate ’em nohow, jest
like two drops of rain water, in a mornin’ glory blow.
And to see ’em nestlin’ there, not carin’ for nobody
outside the blow, contented and bound up in each
other, till the sun evaporates ’em, (as it were) and
draws ’em up together into the heaven, not seperatin’
of ’em up there&mdash;why such a marriage as that is a
sight that does men and angels good to look at. But
when a woman sells herself, swaps her purity, her
self respect, her truth, and her sole, for barter of any
kind, such as a house and lot, a few thousand dollars,
the name of bein’ married, a horse and buggy, some
jewellry, and etcetery, and not only sells herself, but
worse than the Turk wimmen goes round herself,
huntin’ up a buyer, crazy, wild eyed, afraid she won’t
find none&mdash;when she does find one, suppose she does
have a minister for salesman, my contempt for that
female is unmitigable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>Betsey still looked so wrapped up in dignity, as she
bravely attacted the seat of another pair of trousers,
that it fairly made me mad. Insted of that proud and
triumphant mean I wanted her to look some stricken,
and I resumed in a tone of indignaty, almost burnin’
enough to set fire to her apron,</p>

<p>“Nor I don’t want these wimmen that have sold
themselves for a certificate with a man’s name on it&mdash;I
don’t want to hear ’em talk about infamy; haint they
infamous themselves? What have they done different
from these other bad wimmen, only they have got
a stiddy place, and a little better wages, such as
respectability in the eyes of fools and etcetery. Do
you suppose that a woman standin’ up in front of a
minister and tellin’ a few pesky lies, such as, ‘I promise
to love a man I hate, and respect a man that hain’t
respectable, and honor and obey a man I calculate to
make toe the mark’&mdash;do you suppose these few lies
makes her any purer in the eyes of God, than if she
had sold herself without tellin’ ’em, as the other infamous
wimmen did? Not any. Marriage is like baptism,
as I have said more’n a hundred times, you have
got to have the inward grace and the outward form to
make it lawful and right. What good does the water
do, if your sole haint baptised with the love of God?
It haint no better than fallin’ into the creek.”</p>

<p>I paused, spotted in the face from conflictin’ emotions,
and Betsey begun in a haughty triumphant tone,</p>

<p>“Woman’s speah&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>Which words and tone combined with recollections
of the aged sufferer in the blue swallow tailed coat,
so worked on my indignation, that I walked out of
the house without listenin’ to another word, and put
on my bunnet out in the door yard.</p>

<p>But I hollered back to her from the bars&mdash;for Josiah
Allen’s wife haint one to desert duty in any crisis&mdash;“that
the four youngest boys ought to be sweat, and
take some saffern tea, and I should give the five girls,
and the twins, some catnip, and I’d let the rest of ’em
be, till the docter come.”</p>

<p>I haint seen Betsey since, for she is havin’ a hard
time of it. She has to work like a dog. For Simon
Slimpsey bein’ so poor, and not bein’ no calculator, it
makes it hard for ’em to get along. And the old man
seems to have lost what little energy he had, since he
was married, Betsey is so hard on him. He has the
horrors awfully. Betsey takes in work, but they have
a hard time to get along. Miss Gowdey says that
Betsey told her that she didn’t mind workin’ so hard,
but she did hate to give up writin’ poetry, but she
didn’t get no time for it. So as is generally the case,
a great good to the world has come out of her sufferin’.</p>

<p>I guess she haint wrote but one piece sense she was
married and they was wrote I suppose the day I
ketched her with her teeth out, for they come out in
the next week’s Gimlet, for just as quick as the Editor
of the Auger was married, Betsey changed her politix
and wrote agin as formally for the Gimlet.</p>

<h2 id="HORACE_AND_JOSIAH">HORACE AND JOSIAH.</h2>

<p>When the news come to me that Horace Greely
was dead I almost cried. The tears did just run
down my face like rain-water, I don’t know when I
have come nearer cryin’ than I did then. And my first
thought was, they have tried awful hard to keep him
out of the White House, but he has got into one
whiter than any they have got in Washington, D. C.
And then my very next thought was, Josiah Allen’s
wife did you say anything to hurt that man’s feelin’s,
when you was a tryin’ to influence him on your
tower?</p>

<p>I believe if folks would only realize how every
harsh word, and cold look they stab lovin’ hearts with,
would just turn round like bayonets, and pierce their
own heart in a time like this&mdash;they would be more
careful how they handled ’em. But glad enough was
I to think that I didn’t say a hard word to him, but
had freed my mind, and told him jest how good I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
thought he was, and how much he had done for the
Black African, and the Human Race, before it was
too late. Glad enough was I that I didn’t wait till
that noble heart was cold and lifeless, and couldn’t be
pained by unkindness, or made gladder by sympathy,
before I gin him mine.</p>

<p>But in the time of trouble, the love that had been
his best reward for all the successes of his hard workin’
life, had gone from him. And I know jest how
that great heart ached for that love and sympathy.
I know jest how poor the praise of the world would
have looked to him, if he couldn’t have seen it a shinin’
through them lovin’ eyes&mdash;and how hard it was
for him to bear its blame alone. Tired out, defeated
the world called him, but he only had to fold his
hands, and shet his eyes up and he was crowned with
success in that world where He, who was once rejected
by a majority, crowned with thorns of earthly defeat
waits now to give the crown of Eternal Repose to all
true souls, all the weary warriors on life’s battle
field who give their lives for the right. And it
seemed so kinder beautiful too, to think that before
she he loved so, hardly had time to feel strange
in them a “many mansions,” he was with her agin, and
they could keep house together all through Eternity.</p>

<p>Yet,&mdash;though as I say, I don’t know when I have
come so near cryin’ as I did then&mdash;I said to myself as
I wiped my eyes on my apron, I wouldn’t call him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
back from that happy rest he had earnt so well if I
could.</p>

<p>But there are other things that are worrysome to
me, and make me a sight of trouble. It was a day or
2 after this, and I was settin’ alone, for Josiah had
gone to mill, and Thomas Jefferson and Maggy Snow
and Tirzah Ann and Whitfield Minkley had gone a
slay ridin’, (them two affairs is in a flourishin’ condition
and it is <em>very</em> aggreeable to Josiah and me, though
I make no matches, nor break none&mdash;or that is, I don’t
make none, only by talkin’ in a encouragin’ manner,
nor break none only with thoroughwert in a mild
way).</p>

<p>I sot all alone, a cuttin’ carpet rags, and a musin’
sadly. Victory in jail! And though I felt that she
richly deserved it, and I should liked to have shut
her up myself in our suller way, for darin’ to slander
Beecher, still to me who knows her sect so well, it
seemed kinder hard that a woman should be where
she couldn’t go a visatin’. And then to think the
good talkin’ to, I give her when I was on my tower
hadn’t ammounted to nothin’, seemin’ly. I wasn’t
sorry I had labored with her&mdash;not a mite, I had did
my duty anyway. And I knew jest as well as I know
that my name was formally Smith, that when anybody
is a workin’ in the Cause of Right, they hadn’t ought
to be discouraged if they didn’t get their pay down,
for you can’t sow your seeds and pick your posys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
the same day anyway. And I know that great idees
was enough sight harder to get rooted and a growin’
than the Century plant, and that takes a hundred
years for it to blow out.</p>

<p>I know all this, but human nater gets kinder tired
a waitin’, and there seems no end to the snows that
lay between us and that summer that all earnest
souls are a workin’ for. And then I want my
sect to do right,&mdash;I want ’em to be real respectable,
and I felt that take Victory all together she wasn’t
a orniment to it. I thought of my sect, and then I
thought of Victory, and then I sithed. Beecher a
bein’ lied about, Tilton ditto and the same, for you
see <em>I</em> don’t nor won’t believe what Victory says
against ’em, although they don’t come out and
deny the truth of it, either of ’em, just to satisfy some
folks who say that they ought to. Miss Anthony
havin’ a hard tussle of it at Rochester.</p>

<p>Whitfield Minkley had told me too that day
that Miss Aster didn’t keep tavern herself, and
there I had had all my trouble about her for nothin’,
demeanin’ myself by offerin’ to wash dishes for&mdash;I
know not who. And to think that Jonothan Beans’es
ex-wife should have deceived me so, when I
befriended her so much when she first went to grass.
And then when I thought how all the good advice I
had given Victory hadn’t done her no good, and how
Mr. Greely had died, before the seeds I sowed in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
bosom on the great question of Wimmen’s Rights had
sprouted and brought forth fruit, when I see my
tower had been in vain, say nothin’ of the money it
cost, oh! how holler the world looked to me, it
almost seemed as if it would break in and let me
through, rockin’ chair and all.</p>

<p>As I sot there a mewsin’ over it, and a cuttin’
my rags, I almost made up my mind that I would
have the dark stripe in my carpet black as a
coal, the whole on it, a sort of mournin’ stripe. But
better feelin’s got up inside of my mind, and I felt
that I would put in my but’nut color rather than
waste it.</p>

<p>Yet oh how holler and onstiddy everything looked
to me; who could I trust, whose apron string could I
cling to, without expectin’ it would break off short
with me? For pretty nigh 2 minutes and a half I
had the horrors almost as bad as Simon Slimpsey, (he
has ’em now every day stiddy, Betsey is so hard on
him), but oh how sweetly in that solemn time
there came to me the thought of Josiah. Yes, on
that worrysome time I can truly say that Josiah
Allen was my theme, and I thought to myself, there
may be handsomer men than he is, and men that
weigh more by the steelyards, but there hain’t one to
be found that has heftier morals, or more well seasoned
principles than he has. Yes, Josiah Allen was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
my theme, I felt that I could trust my Josiah. I
guess I had got mewsin’ agin on jails and wickedness,
and so 4th, for all of a sudden the thought knocked
aginst my heart,</p>

<p>“What if Josiah Allen should go to cuttin’ up, and
behavin’?”</p>

<p>I wouldn’t let the thought in, I ordered it out. But
it kep’ a hangin’ round,&mdash;</p>

<p>“What if your Josiah should go to cuttin’ up?”</p>

<p>I argued with it; says I to myself, I guess I know
Josiah Allen, a likelier man never trod shoe leather.
I know him like a book.</p>

<p>But then thinks’es I&mdash;what strange critters men and
wimmin be. Now you may live with one for years, and
think you know every crook and turn in that critter’s
mind, jest like a book; when lo! and behold! all of a
sudden a leaf will be turned over, that had been glued
together by some circumstance or other, and there will
be readin’ that you never set eyes on before. Sometimes
it is in an unknown tongue&mdash;sometimes it is
good readin’, and then again, it is bad. Oh how gloomy
and depressted I was. But Josiah Allen’s wife haint
one to give up to the horrers without a tussle, and
though inwardly so tosted about, I rose up and with a
brow of calm, I sot my basket of carpet rags behind
the door, and quietly put on the tea-kettle, for it was
about time for Josiah to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>Then I looked round to see if there was anything I
could do to make it look more pleasant than it did for
Josiah Allen when he came home cold and tired from
the Jonesville mill. It never was my way to stand
stun still in the middle of the floor and smile at him
from half to three-quarters of an hour. Yet it was always
my idee that if a woman can’t make home the
pleasantest spot in the world for her husband, she
needn’t complain if he won’t stay there any more than
he can help. I believe there wouldn’t be so many men
a meanderin’ off nights into grog shops, and all sorts
of wickedness, if they had a bright home and a cheerful
companion to draw ’em back, (not but what men
have to be corrected occasionally, I have to correct Josiah
every little while.) But good land! It is all I can
do to get Josiah Allen and Thomas Jefferson out of
the house long enough to mop.</p>

<p>I looked round the room, as I said, but not a thing
did I see that I could alter for the better; it was slick
as a pin. The painted floor was a shinin’ like yaller
glass, (I had mopped jest before dinner.) The braided
mats, mostly red and green, was a layin’ smooth
and clean in front of the looking-glass, and before the
stove, and table. Two or three pictures, that Thomas
Jefferson had framed, hung up aginst the wall, which
was papered with a light colored buff ground work
with a red rose on it. The lounge and two or three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
rockin’ chairs was cushioned with handsome copper
plate. And Tirzah Ann had got a hangin’ basket of
ivy on the west winder that made that winder look like
summer. I’ll bet her canary hangin’ there in the thickest
of the green leaves, thought it was summer, he sang
like it. The stove hearth shone like a silver dollar,
and there was a bright fire, and in a minute the tea-kettle
began to sing most as loud as Whitey, that is
her canary’s name. (I mistrust she named it in that
kinder underhanded way, after Whitfield Minkley&mdash;though
I never let her know I mistrusted it, but I
never could think of any other earthly reason why she
should call it Whitey, for it is as yaller as any goslin’
I ever laid eyes on.)</p>

<p>I felt that I couldn’t alter a thing round the house
for the better. But as I happened to glance up into
the lookin’-glass, I see that although I looked well, my
hair was slick and I had on a clean gingham dress, my
brown and black plaid, still I felt that if I should pin
on one of Tirzah Ann’s bows that lay on the little shelf
under the lookin’-glass I might look more cheerful and
pleasant in the eyes of my companion Josiah. I haint
made a practice of wearin’ bows sense I jined the meetin’-house.
And then agin I felt that I was too old to
wear ’em. Not that I felt bad about growin’ old. If
it was best for us to have summer all the year round,
I know we should have it. As I have said to Josiah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
Allen more’n once when he got kinder doun hearted,
says I, Josiah Allen look up where the stars are shinin’
and tell me if you think that with all them countless
worlds, with all that wealth in His hands, and His
lovin’ heart, the Lord begruches anything that is for
His children’s good. No! I am willin’ to take God’s
year as it comes, summer and winter.</p>

<p>And then do you s’pose I would if I could by turning
my hand over, go back into my youth agin, and
leave Josiah part way down hill alone? No! the sunshine
and the mornin’ are on the other side of the hill,
and we are goin’ down into the shadders, my pardner
Josiah and me. But we will go like Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph John, that Tirzah Ann sings about&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Hand in hand we’ll go</div>
<div class="verse i1">And we’ll sleep together at the foot.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">knowing that beyond them shadders is the sunshine of
God’s Great Mornin’.</p>

<p>As I said, I don’t make a practice of wearin’ bows,
and this bein’ fire red, I should have felt a awful backslidin’
feelin’ about wearin’ it, if I hadn’t felt that principle
was upholdin’ me.</p>

<p>Then I drawed out the table, and put on a clean
white table-cloth, and begun to set it. I had some
good bread and butter, I had baked that day, and my
bread was white as snow, and light as day, some canned
peaches, and some thin slices of ham as pink as a
rose, and a strawberry pie,&mdash;one of my cans had bust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
that day, and I made ’em up into pies. And then I
brought up some of my very best cake, such as I keep
for company&mdash;fruit cake, and delicate cake. And then
after I had put on a great piece of white honey in a
glass dish, and some cheese that was like cream for
richness, the table looked well.</p>

<p>I had got the table all set, and had jest opened the
door to see if he was a comin’, when lo! and behold!
there he stood on the doorstep&mdash;he had come and put
his horses out before I see him. He looked awful depressted,
and before he got the snow half off’en his
boots, says he:</p>

<p>“That new whip I bought the other day is gone Samantha.
Some feller stole it while I was gettin’ my
grist ground.”</p>

<p>Says I, “Josiah I have been a mewsin’ on the onstiddiness,
and wickedness of the world all day, and
now that whip is gone. What is the world a comin’ to,
Josiah Allen?”</p>

<p>Josiah is a man that don’t say much, but things wear
on him. His face looked several inches longer than it
usially did, and he answered in a awful depressted
tone:</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Samantha, but I do know, that I am
as hungry as a bear.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” says I, soothingly, “I thought you would
be, supper’s all on the table.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>He stepped in, and the very minute that man ketched
sight of that cheerful room, and that supper table,
that man smiled. And it wasn’t a sickly, deathly smile
either, it was a smile of deep inward joy and contentment.
And says he in a sweet tone, “it seems to me
you have got a awful good supper to-night, Samantha.”</p>

<p>As I see that smile, and looked into that honest
beamin’ face, I jest turned out them gloomy forebodin’s
about him, out of my heart, the whole caboodle
of ’em, and shet the door in their faces. But I controlled
my voice, till it sounded like a perfect stranger
to me, and says I:</p>

<p>“Don’t I always get good suppers, Josiah Allen?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says he, “and good dinners and breakfess’es,
too. I will say this for you, Samantha, there haint a
better cook in Jonesville, than you be, nor a woman
that makes a pleasanter home.” And he went on placidly,
as he stood there with his back to the fire a
warmin’ him, a lookin’ serenely round that bright
warm room, and ont’ that supper table.</p>

<p>“There haint no place quite so good as home, is
there, Samantha? haint supper about ready?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;" id="illus56">
<img src="images/illus56.jpg" width="520" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE PLEASANT SUPPER</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>

<p>Says I, firmly, “The Cause of Right, and the Good
of the Human Race will ever be dear to the soul of
her who was formally Samantha Smith. But at
the same time that don’t hender me from thinkin’ a
sight of my home, and from gettin’ good suppers. It
will be ready, Josiah, jest as quick as the tea is steeped,
I didn’t want to make it till you come, for bilein’
jest spiles that last tea you got,” and I went on in
tones as firm as Plymouth Rock, yet as tender as a
spring chicken.</p>

<p>“As I have said more’n a hundred times, if it is
spelt right there haint another such a word as home
in the English language. The French can’t spell it
at all, and in my opinion that is jest what makes ’em
so light minded and onstiddy. If it is spelt wrong,
as in the case of Bobbet and Slimpsey, it means the
horrors, and the very worst kinds of discomfort and
misery. In fact love is the only school-master, that
can put out that word worth a cent. And if it is put
out by him, and spelt, for instance, by a couple who
have loved each other for goin’ on fifteen years, with
a firm and almost cast iron affection, why it stands for
peace and rest and comfort, and is the plainest picture
God has give us below, kinder as we put painted pictures
in children’s story books, of that great Home
above, where the colors won’t never rub off of the picture,
and the peace and the rest are everlasting.”</p>

<p>I had been real eloquent, I knew it, and Josiah
knew it, for that man looked awful kinder earnest and
serene like. He was silent for mebby half or three
quarters of a minute, and then he said in calm, gentle
tones:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess I’ll carry the grist up stairs before supper,
Samantha, and have it done with.”</p>

<p>There haint a lazy hair in that man’s head, and for
that matter there haint many of any kind, either smart
or shiftless, he grows bald every day, not that I blame
him for it.</p>

<p>He came down stairs, and we sot down to the table,
happy as a king and queen, for all the old world was
a caperin’ and cuttin’ up as if it would go crazy. The
little blackslidin’ feelin’ about wearin’ that fire red bow
died away too, as ever and anon, and I don’t know but
oftener, I would look up and ketch the eye of my companion
Josiah bent on me in a pleasant and sort of a
admirin’ way. That bow was becomin’ to me I knew.
For as Josiah passed me his cup for his second cup of
tea, (no dishwatery stuff, I can tell you) he says:<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>“I don’t see what makes you look so young and
handsome, to-night, Samantha, I believe I shall have
to go to courtin’ you over agin.”</p>

<p>And I answered him in the same aggreable accents,
“I don’t know as the law could touch you for it Josiah
if you did.”</p>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
